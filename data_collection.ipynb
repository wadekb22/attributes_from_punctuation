I have no faith in her ability whatsoever. Especially since last year when my dad had heart surgery and he was on a ventilator for a few weeks after because of complications... He was almost dead, and his stupid fucking girlfriend was trying to arrange all of this shit that he never would have wanted. Last rights, elaborate funeral, etc. She was pretending to be married to him so that she could make the decisions. Which was both his and her idea.

He doesn't want to suffer, but based on what happened last time he was on life support... She was making choices that we're in line with her wishes not his. Which is fucked up. She also told us that he was sleeping a lot because he was having trouble breathing. I'm glad I went to the hospital because he was not \"sleeping a lot\" he was in a coma. He wasn't having \"trouble breathing\" he was on a ventilator because he couldn't breath on his own!
