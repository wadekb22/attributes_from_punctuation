      "go on, tell me how im not considerate.@ suggestions? no i dont like everything i do in my home being question.   its the little things like why have you taken the bins out a certain way (back gate over the front gate).   shes also got bleach over my bathroom unit, she hasnt told me.  she also barged past me when i told/asked her to not take her bike in the front door because it was full of a kitchen delivery i wanted. i told her the night she came back and the second time she kicked up a fuss. its completely unreasonable as she always wanted to come in the side gate and when i asked her because of a legitimate reason she told me no and barged past me. its also a side gate that she wouldnt be able to lock when exit so we dont use it.   so again, im completely reasonable.@ its my home though, i own the property, i paid for the cups. i think its petty to have a conversation where the cups will be, because ultimate its my decision. there is no wrong of right way to put them and i cant think of any reason why they should be there.   as a result of me moving the cups to the shelf (new shelf) above the kettle and next to the sink she has told me that the kitchen looks smaller and she doesnt like them there. firstly the kitchen cant look smaller as its behind a wall and you only see the shelf when you are standing in front of it. its a tiny shelf. so shes just being a negative twat.@ constant criticism.  i put up a shelf in the kitchen - it makes the room look smaller (its a 30cm shelf thats only visible face on).   than she wants stuff like adding to bills and i tel her no.   everything is a case of she knows better.@ because she also moved all the cups because their position didnt suit her. so i had to move them back. shes taking the piss@ because its a case of whats next.  i got questioned why i was bringing the bins out a certain way. was told i should paint the fence before hanging them.@ my neighbour watches tv every night without his hearing aids in. annoying@ i can cope fine. it just i want support from my family.@ yeah nowadays there would be everyone with their cameras out@ see what people in manchester are doing. shall i go to ask croatia.@ michael barrymore@ cringe@ nope@ schools are shut you dumb fuck.@ memory recall@ hes not normally like this but clearly doesnt understand. thinks this persons suicide attempt was due to alcohol only, nope, you arent part of the mental health team or spoken to the person so dont assume that.@ i wrote those not spending it with family ffs@ nah its going to be like this for good@ cringe@ it so is lol@ so you are spending it with family@ you saw the title first@ are you kidding me. you are on an apprenticeship  and earning so much?@ is it bad i laughed at this@ boyfriend is family@ doesnt sound like you are alone?@ whats the work from home tax code?@ before i ask the obvious, have you tried to talk to them? also annoying your post got a thumbs up and mine didnt@ couple of options. you can get the owners details from a website, land registry or something.  waybackmachine for past listings of properties.@ what sort of traits?@ thats how it works though. if they are on the same salary, yeah fine. more, obviously not.@ pay brackets dont mean the person get the top salary regardless of experience. you can be sure the next person is getting 26.@ i dont know what the issue is.   the job is for 26-30. you can be sure they will pay 26.   you are on 28.   just look around.@ is it your boss or anyone else?

also that much for a cat thats ill but no treatment.   leave it at the vets. they are taking the piss.@ its going to be so hard to get that tax back.@ i dont have a grey bin. what is a grey bin recycling?@ oh how did i miss that!@ yes meat is much better for the environment and human health. again i didnt want to get into this debate.@ fab. thank you.@ ty@ my gp doesnt know best. i would trust a psychiatrist, but even then i have reservations.  gp 1 - didnt suggest taking therapies. put me on a medication that than had an interaction. turned from suicidal idolisation to actual attempt (19 year old). stoped with no support.   psychiatrist 1 - my depression has been so bad that i felt my ad worsened symptoms and it didnt work. i dont want to try again im so scared. her reaction was to try me on the same medication even though i didnt respond the first time.   gp - yeah try the same medication as well. so i tried it, felt unnaturally high, numerous times to the gp. crashed the same as the first time on ad, it went from coping with the thoughts to making plans. i then asked to see a new psychiatrist.   psychiatrist 2 - yes that medication isnt working and im very concerned with the highness. will you try a mood stabiliser? mood stabiliser worked.   so as you can see i dont trust some mental health professionals and with good reason. unlike other diseases that can be measured via blood tests, mental illness isnt treated in the same way. its self reporting of symptoms.@ closed~.@ what does h and m do with the clothes?@ thank you.   i will keep it in mind when i cook a whole chicken.   im fussy as i try and avoid onion and garlic as it doesnt agree with me.@ im not american based :(@ thank you@ will you deliver @ do you count the vegetables that animals eat?

they both help to improve signs of depression~ and one does it by x and the other y?  if ive had a reaction on x than why isnt the doctor trying me on y?@ nope.   which post is being downvoted?@ nope you made the judgment it was about additives. i dont like the idea of eating food that has a long list of ingredients and of those ingredients i dont recognise a lot of them. they may be derived from foods i know and the food tech people know what they are doing~. but i just have a different outlook when i look at the ingredients. i dont really like gravy that much, didnt have it for 7 years and when i tasted it again, was a bit weird. but it helps me to eat vegetables/adds a bit of fun.@ i feel like there is something missing. shes explained where the vowels are but not the rest of the keys - how does she know how to press the top key.@ thanks.  so whats the difference between ssris and snris, in terms of why one doctor would give that class over the other. i know two sisters on different types.@ weirdo. maybe thats why i never get the vegetables i need on a sunday.@ wait what~. https://bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/best-yorkshire-puddings@ 12 slot cake tin. put it in oven to get hot. used a packet mix recently (was in parents cupboard), mixed and put in the cake tray. cooked for time. took out, they tasted rubbery, not light and started to sink.@ why are they under the same umbrella term?@ im doing something wrong as mine turn out pants@ i thought you were saying all the additives were bad. i didnt write anything of the sort. i just didnt want to eat a food where the main ingredient was x.   post is all about gravy and the company bisto. just interested in others and their gravy journey. nothing more, nothing less.@ we - me@ lunch? are you mad. its an evening meal, slightly earlier than week days.@ environmental damage can be reduced by the foods we eat@ yep!  started ssri for a depressive mood.   me: hi doctor i feel so high. like so happy. but unusually happy. this doesnt feel right for me.  doctor: all good babe, probably how you are supposed to feel   me: no it doesnt feel right. i sat in a park for 3 hours just feeling wonderful about the nature and watching children play. i also think my local hairdresser would meet me, hes wonderful for curly hair, we would meet for coffee. this doesnt feel right.  dr: all ok babe   me: visited 7 times over 5 weeks.  me a few weeks later: starts to put plans in place. worst depressive episode with s ive ever felt.   .  psychiatrist: no fucking way is that normal. get of the ssris and get on a mood stabiliser. give him history of how previous meds contributed to plans for s and i dont feel confident taking them (gp was given same history as was another psychiatrist)  mood improved.@ yes and its also my point of why im not eating soy.@ stop eating onions and garlic.   ive noticed that my friend smells and i did as well. i think its the extra sweating? wash your clothes more often, shower more often? buy some cheap clothes as bo does her trapped - see if that helps your increased sense of you smelling.   i have sensitive smell and im horrified that some people walk around smelling~. and others dont notice.@ environmental damage can also be reduced by the foods you eat.@ whats the ingredient list and method please@ i actually dont care about palm oil because im just an ignorant idiot but i guess we are on the same page~. look at the ingredient list for gravy - maltodextrin,  potato starch,  salt,  vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed),  colour (ammonia caramel),  flavour enhancers (monosodium glutamate, disodium 5'-ribonucleotides), flavourings,  beef extract powder (1%) (maltodextrin, beef extract), onion powder,  emulsifier (soya lecithin),  potassium chloride,  black pepper extract,  onion oil,  rosemary extract.   so much farming and food processed, for what! it would be better if i find a way to remove the bad taste of vegs another way. hence why im cutting back to the old style gravy and i will reduce to another form of gravy.  yes bisto best has more meat in it - but i can get this from the joint of meat i have just cooked so its not a gain for me. i have an issue with soy beans because i would rather get my fat and protein from animals. msg is a type of salt and i dont have an issue with it~ but i just dont see the point of eating food with lots of ingredients. i can happily eat eggs, aged cheese, raw meat, meat without seasoning~ its just the vegetables that i cook in animal fat or need to put sauce on.@ bisto best ingredients:   maltodextrin,  potato starch,  salt,  vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed),  flavour enhancers (monosodium glutamate, disodium 5'ribonucleotides), colour (ammonia caramel),  chicken powder (2%),  flavourings,  autolysed yeast,  onion powder,  emulsifier (soya lecithin),  chicken fat,  onion extract,  spice,  black pepper extract,  sage extract,  onion oil,  rosemary extract  bisto original:   potato starch,  salt,  wheat starch,  colour (e150c),  onion powder,  inactive yeast powder (contains barley, wheat)  i think ill just try and make my own.@ omg you make your own yorkies, calm down jamie @ my mums cooking never stretched that far~. mine probably could but im a single person and i hate wasting food.@ bisto best ingredients:   maltodextrin,  potato starch,  salt,  vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed),  flavour enhancers (monosodium glutamate, disodium 5'ribonucleotides), colour (ammonia caramel),  chicken powder (2%),  flavourings,  autolysed yeast,  onion powder,  emulsifier (soya lecithin),  chicken fat,  onion extract,  spice,  black pepper extract,  sage extract,  onion oil,  rosemary extract  bisto original:   potato starch,  salt,  wheat starch,  colour (e150c),  onion powder,  inactive yeast powder (contains barley, wheat)@ there is affordable housing everywhere,~ just not somewhere you want to live haha@ thanks. asda has disconnected all numbers. i ended up just walking down and asking them to come outside@ oh right what it is?

      "> the only way to help it is ~.. constant mindfulness.   interesting idea. would you elaborate a bit more about what kind(s) of \"mindfulness\" you are describing, how/why it helps, and where we can get more info?@ thanks. you have given me some very good food for thought.   i was hoping that someone on reddit would help me to see how this situation could be not so black-and-white as i had felt it was, and you have provided that point of view.   he called me again yesterday and i did not answer. the door is still open.@ i agree. well said.   there has been an enormous body of fascinating scientific research in the past few decades, about psychological trauma and its effects on the brain. i recall, 45 years ago when i first studied psychology in college, that one of my textbooks literally said that, although alcoholism and drug abuse are very bad for the individual, their children appear to be unharmed. we now know that the effects of a traumatic childhood, such as experienced by children whose parents have chemical dependency problems, can be profound and life-long, because they literally change the wiring of the brain in major ways, as you pointed out.   (although i still stand behind my statement that displaced anger does not change brain chemistry in the same ways that depression and schizophrenia do. depression and schizophrenia are more \"bad chemistry\", but displaced anger is more \"bad programming\", i.e., dysfunctional neural pathways which developed as a way to survive a dysfunctional environment but are themselves dysfunctional in a healthy environment.)@ i'm not a neuroscientist/psychiatrist. but i don't think that most neuroscientists and psychiatrists would describe displaced anger as a problem with brain chemistry, in the same sense that depression or schizophrenia are known to be problems with brain chemistry.  displaced anger can be the result of psychological trauma. say, for example, a small boy is physically beaten and/or psychologically abused by a parent. in his mind, he cannot accept the fact that his parent is less than perfect (there are good evolutionary reasons for this, for millions of years, infants/children of primates (apes, monkeys) have required the help of parents to survive).   so how does he emotionally explain to himself why the parent would deliberately hurt him? it has to be someone else's fault, either (1) his own fault or (2) the fault of some human non-parent. if the abuse is frequent, this emotional re-direction of their anger becomes a habit that is so deeply ingrained and frequently practiced that the child himself does not realize what's going on. it is simply their way of dealing with things. it is reality.   therefore, the child is still mad as hell, but the anger cannot be resolved because it is pointing at the wrong target(s).   when that child grows up, they are still mad as hell, but now they have the ability to lash out at their still mis-directed targets. they may \"blow up\" at friends and loved ones for no (or insufficient) reasons. they may hate people who have certain characteristics (such as race) for no reason. of course, they do come up with \"reasons\", which satisfy their own warped sense of who \"deserves\" their anger, but those reasons are obviously insufficient to provoke their attack, and everyone realizes this except them.   displaced anger is very difficult to treat, because the client has to admit to themselves that they've been wrong, for their whole lives, about who they are angry at. this requires a level of humility and intellectual honesty that is, frankly, beyond the capabilities of most humans. although this is surely the way to reduce their pain in the long run, in the short run, it may actually increase their emotional pain, and they aren't willing to do that.   it is much more common for them not to \"get better at handling their emotional problems\", instead they choose to \"get better at displacing their anger and blaming others for their problems\". this may manifest itself in \"therapist shopping\", where the client tries multiple therapists, one after another, until they find one who is willing to tell them that they are essentially blameless and everyone else in their lives really is the cause of their problems (based on the client's own warped view of reality, which is what they tell the therapist). or, the client may simply drop out of therapy because of some perceived fault with the therapist - displacing their anger now against the therapist who is trying to help them.   this happened with my wife. we went to two different marriage counselors, selected solely by her, for several months each, and eventually she rejected both because neither would agree with her perception that i was 100% at fault for all  of the problems in our relationship. after 7 years of searching, two marriage counselors and at least 3 therapists/psychiatrists, she eventually did find a counselor who confidently diagnosed me as a complete sociopath in spite of the fact that he had never met me. for a fee, of course, he was willing to testify to that \"professional diagnosis\" at the trial for custody of our children. (it didn't work. she lost and i got custody. actually, we never went to trial because her lawyer didn't think the judge would believe the counselor, so we settled out of court, but that's a tale for another day.)  your wife needs help badly. i do hope you can find a counselor/therapist who will work with your financial situation and get her started on getting the help she needs.  but frankly, i'm not optimistic. i've lived for 65 years and i've seen lots of people like your description of your wife, and i've never seen a single one change after they've become an adult. not one.@ > i'd much rather she just told me what the actual problem is.  someone with displaced anger often does not know who they are really angry at or what they are really angry about. they may really believe that they had very good reasons to be so angry about driving through a roundabout that the driver deserved a lecture (or worse).   this problem does not automatically get better over time. in fact, it usually gets worse because the original anger continues to fester and grow, without any actual way to vent it because the angry person does not know it's true source.   you can insist that she get therapy now, or you can continue to be her punching bag.@ interesting observation. i'll have to give that some thought. thanks.@ this reminds me of my ex. blew up at the least little thing, and it never made any sense.   i finally put my foot down and told her that i was getting a divorce unless she got professional psychiatric help. she did, years of it, but it didn't do any good.   when i divorced her, we subpoenaed her psychiatric records. her psychiatrist had very thoroughly documented that she had a problem called \"displaced anger\". she was filled with almost volcanic rage at her parents, who had been very abusive to her during her childhood, but they weren't around, so she took her anger out on me.   she never would admit who she was really angry at, or try to deal with her anger problems in any other way, so i had to get out of the marriage to protect my own sanity, and the mental health of our two children. to this day, 30 years later, she still won't admit who she is angry at; she just fabricates completely fictional \"events\" and \"reasons\" why she has the \"right\" to be angry at me and our son (her father had been meaner than her mother, although both had mistreated her, s she has more of a problem with men).   your wife needs serious psychotherapy. if that doesn't help, you need a divorce.@ do you have any mutual friend(s) whom you can ask to contact him and try to find out why he's ghosting you?@ > though there may be reasons he isn't comfortable sharing or doesn't even know  that's what worries me. this guy has had a very difficult life because of his polio (got polio literally just months before the salk vaccine became available).   he appears cynical to people who don't know him well, but after you get to know him, you realize he is just dealing with what life has done to him, and has done so a lot better than most people would have. frankly, if i had had to deal with the difficulties he has, i would not have done nearly as well.   i just don't want to treat the guy unfairly if it is my fault in some way.   but, without more info, i am just going to have to \"go with my gut\" as you recommended, and my gut says \"move on\".@ apparently this friend misled you in at least two ways: (1) gave you the impression that they would be back this week, when in fact they were planning to be gone until december 10, and  (2) did not inform you that one dog occasionally had to be spoon fed, but assured you they would be \"super good\".   also, it appears to me that they pressured you into this on short notice, because they decided to \"go abroad\" \"on a whim\".   if they can afford that fancy vacation, they can afford to hire a a dog sitter or to board their dogs. but you are saving them a lot of money (boarding costs $15-35 per dog per night in alabama, where i live).  they have really taken advantage of you in this situation. you need to call them, be honest with them about the problems these dogs are causing, tell them the situation is intolerable and suggest several local places where you can take the dogs to be boarded, at their expense, until they return. (you can call around ahead of time before you talk with them, and get the names, and rates, of several reputable local places.)  be prepared for the s*** to hit the fan, but stand your ground. their dogs are their responsibility.   i'm not sure what your liabilities might be if they refuse to consent for you to take their dogs to boarding. if that happens, you should post your problem on r/legaladvice.  edit: also, be sure to ask potential boarding locations what kinds of immunization/vet records they require, get the dogs' vet's name from your friends, and tell them to call the vet and give their permission for you to get copies of these records.@ i am very sorry (and also angry) that your wife had to undergo this horrible experience. it was simply cruel that a doctor's office staff would treat her like that.   but there is a \"silver lining\" in that cloud.   if your wife's doctor was committing medicare/medicaid fraud, he/she was also a bad doctor from a clinical point of view. although getting \"fired\" in this situation was certainly unpleasant emotionally, it very probably saved your wife from receiving some very bad medical care, so she is better off going to another doctor.   (i realize that the office manager, not the doctor, got arrested for fraud. but, whenever the office manager is doing something like that, the doctor is always a willing participant and beneficiary. perhaps the police just could not find enough evidence to indict the doctor, or maybe the doctor turned \"states evidence\" and agreed to testify against the office manager. or maybe they're still gathering evidence against the doctor.)  btw, now that the medical community is aware that your wife's former doctor was a bad one, your wife's primary doctor should be able to recommend a specialist doctor who will accept her if she needs specialty care. other doctors will believe, correctly, that her former doctor's \"problems\" with your wife were their fault, not hers.@ wow. just wow. the coolest, most precise revenge. ever!! for the rest of his life, paul will have to be reminded of what an ass he was.@ nta. but you need a lawyer now. that's enough money that at least some of your relatives will fight you for it. it won't be pretty and some of them won't fight fair.   the good part about this situation, aside from the fact that you're now financially set for life, is that all of your relatives are going to reveal their true selves.   after it's over, you will know who the good ones are - the ones that fight fair or simply accept your grandfather's decision without fighting at all. you will be free to reward them if you want to. it's your money. if you love these people you will probably enjoy sharing some of it with them, and you will have plenty to share.    you will also be free to give nothing to those relatives who showed you that they were greedy and dishonest.@ yta. i raised two children, boy and girl, as a single dad from the time that my son was 9 and my daughter was 3. i received precisely zero help from my parents, and my ex and her parents were worse than no help. so i was 100% on my own.   i was a software engineer for a \"baby bell\" telecom company, so i was more than \"essential\". tornadoes, hurricanes, the blizzard of 1993 when my whole metro area lost electrical power for a week, didn't matter. i was essential. also, i was on-call 24x7 with no backup.  my children never missed a meal.   but on those rare occasions when i had to go to work and they were hungry, (this was before broadband, so i could not log on from home, i had to physically go to work), i always made sure that i had a pantry and fridge that were full of things that would be easy for them to prepare without my help (canned soups, tv dinners, cereal, bread for sandwiches, etc), or required no preparation at all (fruits, lunch-ables, foods that i'd already prepared, etc).  if you had been polite with your sister, you'd get a nah. she might have been selfish to turn you down, or maybe she was just trying to be a good student.   but the way you talked to her was simply rude and pretty much guarantees that you won't be getting any help from her in the future, when your children will need it.@ nta.  i spent 30+ years working for various corporations in healthcare, telecom, is consulting and finance, as a software engineer. these were all very highly respected, large companies.   the companies who actually did reward their salaried employees only asked for 40-45 hours work per week. in those rare instances where they did require more time (which often happens in the software biz, no way to avoid it), they provided an immediate verbal \"thank you\" and very quickly followed up with more tangible rewards like comp time off, extra year-end bonuses, etc.   the ones who constantly demanded huge amounts of extra work time because we were supposed to be \"team players\" never never followed through on their faux promises to reward us. they just kept asking for more until we all had heart attacks, got stress ulcers, quit, or all of the above.   you are being used and abused. your boss and employer will never reward your extra efforts, because if they were going to they would have already done so. they will just keep asking for you to do more. and then they will lay off or fire a bunch of people, including probably you, because something is eventually going to blow up and you can be certain that your workaholic boss (and her boss and their boss) won't take the blame.   so say, \"no\", but update your resume and get out as fast as you can.@ yta.   i live in north alabama, not far from huntsville, where there is a huge nasa space center.   thousands of people work for nasa and have very fulfilling careers/lives without ever being an astronaut. there are a huge number of jobs that your son could have with nasa, or with other employers (e.g., he could be an astronomer at a university or just do pure research), that would use his interest in space, be great jobs and be very rewarding.   **i'd be willing to bet that the vast majority of these nasa scientists, engineers and others wanted to be astronauts when they were the same age as your son.**  so, you should encourage his interest in space exploration/technology in every way possible. he will figure the rest out on his own when he is emotionally ready for it.@ nta. it is likely that there's something(s) in the house that she doesn't want you to see, for the wrong reasons. is she hoarding? is there another guy crashing there? is she doing drugs? you don't know.   i have another, larger concern. this lady sounds very psychologically unstable. she has told you that she thinks, \"you're a dangerous man\". if you go back there, you run the risk of her falsely accusing you of something terrible. you could be arrested, charged with crimes that never happened, etc.   it simply isn't worth the risk, to you personally, of continuing to physically go to her house.   you are completely justified in cutting her off.   if your wife still wants to help her and is unable to do so herself, she can hire someone else to do the deliveries.@ yta. but ~. there's a silver lining to this cloud. you don't care, so you are doing your grandchild a favor by staying out of their life. therefore, if you want to stay out, stay out.   my step-grandmother (father's step-mother, my grandfather's second wife after his first wife died) never gave a damn about me. but my mom and dad kept trying to include her in our lives.   i never could understand why my grandmother didn't love me, because i dearly loved her.   decades later, it still hurts.   so do your grandchild a favor and, if you really don't care, don't send mixed signals. stay out of their life.@ to resolve this problem, you need to take a deep, close look at the evidence against christianity. here are some resources that can help you. most are free:  informative web sites:

mentally ill. my post clearly says that drg is an \"internist\", i.e., a specialist in internal medicine, not a psychiatrist.   my post also clearly says, \"the staff understood that they could not \"fire\" patients who were so sick that they couldn't keep themselves from behaving the way they did.\"   i don't mind criticism, but it would be nice if you would actually read things before criticizing them.@ many (not all) doctors are complete idiots when it comes to hiring/managing their own employees. they hire as cheaply as they can and are completely oblivious to the fact that you get what you pay for.   drg realized that:  (1) you don't have to pay twice as much to get an employee who is twice as effective. usually 10-20% over the average (mean) does it for you.   (2) work environment and leadership are at least as important as the amount you pay in salaries/benefits. and those things usually cost very little, except you have to give up a lot of ego and do things like listen to what your employees are telling you and assume that they are smart enough to know/do their jobs, things which are damn near impossible for some doctors (md = \"minor deity\")@ i'm so glad that you had a supportive boss. in the deep south, where i live, it's sometimes difficult to find bosses, even lady bosses, who are willing to stand up against sexual harassment of their employees.@ as i said, we had to be sure to do it only when certain managers were on duty, who had been there a long time and hated the \"repeat complainers\" as much as we did. newer managers were more beholden to corporate (and scared of getting fired), and \"when it hits the fan it flows downhill\". so if they got a butt chewing, the server did too.   and we did it only on the customers who had a reputation for being chronically a pain in the butt. the district manager (dm) was pretty cool. the first time a particular customer would \"call corporate\", the dm would call the restaurant manager. but by the third of fourth time the same customer called the dm with the same complaints, he figured out what was going on and didn't hassle anybody.   in the short term, it worked because it made us all feel better. it was like \"you make our lives miserable, we will give you crappy service\".   plus, if you knew you weren't going to waste your time on a particular table, you could usually pick up an extra table and make tips from it. so that was a substantial benefit.   in the longer term, i'm not so sure. did it make them less likely to come to our restaurant and go somewhere else? i'd like to think it did. but i don't know anyone who was keeping score.@ ok, zyzmog and daggerdragon, i do have one revenge story that happened between two of my employees, both ladies, that i can tell you about.  one lady, whom i'll call annaconda, stole the boyfriend (or husband, i can't remember) from the other one, whom i'll call grizelda.   annaconda drove a beat up old car which had been wrecked at the driver's side door, so she had to get in through the passenger's side door. the result was that she didn't see what was on the outside of her driver's side door when she got into her car.   grizelda took a spray can of paint and painted, \"best piece of ass in town\" and annaconda's phone number, on the driver's side.   it actually took several days for annaconda to figure out why she was getting so many phone calls from guys she didn't know.   but when annaconda found out, she immediately knew that grizelda had done it, and the result wasn't pretty. fortunately, the fight happened off-site and after working hours, so the hospital wasn't involved and we didn't have to fire them.   but they both got to be consumers of our hospital's er services (we were sure to put them on opposite sides of the er, as far apart as possible), and they used up all of their sick & vacation days waiting for their families to raise enough money to pay for their bail.@ > i still think it would make a good revenge story.   i have to admit you're right. you can cross post it if you want to. i've already posted it here and on r/talesfrommedicine, and i don't want to look greedy.@ i worked my way through healthcare management school as a waiter.   i totally agree. the restaurants i worked at were owned by a big corporation that was headquartered in another city far away, so they didn't have to deal with bad customers, who kept on being a pain and kept coming back again and again.   the managers hated these customers at least as much as the rest of us did, and there was nothing they could do except \"keep the customer happy\".   the part i never understood was that the restaurant was losing money on them, because they kept sending food back for nonexistent problems, tying up a table which could have been used by more decent customers, etc. and then they would insist on a comp meal and the manager would usually have to give it to them.   eventually, though all of the serving staff got together and figured out a way to deal with some of the worst ones. we just slowed everything down, got orders deliberately wrong, etc. we figured that they were going to make the manager give them a free meal, and never leave any tip at all, no matter what we did.   even a free meal isn't worth it if you don't like the food and it takes you over an hour to get a meal that should have taken 15 minutes. we could only do it when certain managers were on duty, though, and only for the worst chronic offenders, that kept coming back for free food.@ drg was really not interested in in revenge. he was only trying to protect his staff from abusive patients.   unfortunately, having been in the hospital management business for many years, i do have some \"revenge\" stories that involve doctors, hospital staff, etc. but for obvious legal reasons, i cannot discuss them. they're too bad for reddit anyway. people really did get hurt, sometimes seriously.@ ok. no problem.@ emt's are amazing. they will walk straight into hell to help people, and think that it's \"just a normal day's work\".   i have the highest admiration for emt's.@ i actually did talk with one of the hospital's lawyers about this, shortly after drg told me. our lawyer told me that you cannot discriminate because of race, color, age, disability, sex, national origin, etc. but, as i said in my post, the sickest patients could not be \"fired\".   assholes are not a protected group, and, unless they are discriminating against a protected group, no doctor is legally obligated to provide care to anyone, except in an emergency (which has a precise legal definition that i won't go into. you can google it.)  drg did give us some examples while we were discussing his \"christmas presents\". they were just about always patients who were not very sick, they were just abusive, entitled jerks.@ > the doc isnt preventing these patients from receiving vital treatment when they need it to survive nor abandoning them willynilly. it seems that doc adheres to my philosophy regarding his staff.   well said, valkyriewild@ this isn't retribution, thatsironic_. drg was trying to protect his staff from abuse.   my post said, \"the staff understood that they could not \"fire\" patients who were so sick that they couldn't keep themselves from behaving the way they did. they could only \"fire\" patients who were capable of acting like decent human beings, but chose to be assholes.\"   considering the way that some patients treat nurses, etc., if you had merely been as you said, \"i'm freaking sick, i snap at the employee once\", you would never have even made it into the worst 100.@ > cant help but feel bad for the assholezz  if you had sat down with drg and listened to him describe some of the assholes he fired, you would not feel sorry for them. these were not extremely sick people who couldn't help themselves. they were just rude, mean spirited and hateful to the staff.@ actually, the doctor's name did not start with \"g\". drg  is a pun on \"diagnostic related groups\", which are used for statistics, reimbursement, etc.@ thank you. i did not know about this subreddit. i'll post it there too.@ ianal, but this kind of issue has come up several times in my 30+ year career in software engineering in various businesses and roles.   by far, the best course of action is for you to have an open, honest discussion with your current employer, starting with your boss and then anyone he/she recommends, about what you are planning to do, and simply ask them whether they have a problem with it.   there is a good chance they are going to find out anyway, sooner or later, and this will let them know that you are an honest person who is trying to do the right thing.   then, if they say that they don't have a problem with it (which i think is likely, based on your description), you follow up with an email to the people you talked with and say, \"this will confirm our conversation today, that i intend to do x, and you, my employer, don't have any problem with it.\" and your butt is covered.   if they do say they have a problem with it, at least you will know and can pro-actively take corrective / protective action, such as discussing it in detail with a lawyer who specializes in this kind of question, or limiting the scope of your business, etc.@ ianal, but i did endure a year long custody fight over my two children (boy 9 & girl 3), and i won, which is pretty unusual for a guy in alabama.   child custody is war, and they rarely fight fair. you have to plan for your ex to use any excuse to make up lies about you that you would have to disprove. judges are pretty good at detecting bs, but they're still human and if she piles up enough lies, they might begin to look plausible due to sheer mass.   you have to keep yourself squeaky clean and pure as the driven snow. even the appearance of something questionable will put you at risk. you can count on it being distorted and used against you to the maximum extent possible.   i my case, my ex hired a private investigator to follow me around for days, told all of our mutual friends that i was screwing around with multiple women (not true - never, not even one), hired a shady psychologist to testify that i was an abuser even though he had never even met me, and even got a friend to pretend to be a \"hit man\" and offer to \"take her out\" for a reasonable fee. (i'm sure he was wired; i just said \"hell no\" and walked away.)  if a lie has some plausibility, such as \"hangs out with a registered sex offender\", even if the guy has no contact with your son, it is just one more thing that can be used against you.   personally, i don't buy this guy's story that, \"he didn't know how old she was\", but admits she was 14.   but even if he is telling the truth, is this guy worth the risk?@ there's a lot of wisdom in that. some of life's greatest truths are very simple, although they are also very deep.@ thanks for the info. i did not know there was a cptsd subreddit. i've joined it and i'm digesting the info as rapidly as i can.   \"~vomiting as opposed to venting is not the path~\" well said.@ wow. just wow!!! i am very impressed and i am very glad you did this. i'm going to download this, print it and keep it in my library, and (obviously) read it in detail.   one of the most healing things that an ex-christian can do is to use their unique knowledge to help heal others. you've done a great job at that!!  you should really consider self-publishing this, so that it will be available, in book form, through online booksellers like amazon and alibris. there are several self-publishing \"print on demand\" services that are pretty economical, although i don't have any experience with any of them so i cannot recommend a specific one.   btw, you might be interested in my youtube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/freethinkersbooks@ thank you. i have had universally bad experiences with therapists and psychiatrists, even those that i was referred to by my doctor, employee assistance program (eap), etc. eight of them, whom i tried for multiple sessions each, over many years (not counting the ones who were so obviously psycho that i never went back after the first meeting).   one, whom my eap assured me was a secular counselor, tried to recruit me to his wacky religious cult. another tried to have sex with me (he was not subtle - he put his hands all over me and asked me if i was \"horny\").   another, a psychiatrist who had been selected by my father, who was an alcoholic and a physician, said, on the first visit, that the fact that both of my parents were drunks \"shouldn't bother\" me and if it did, he would involuntarily admit me to bryce's hospital, which was the state mental institution in alabama, where you went in and never got out. i was 14 years old at the time, eagle scout, honor student.  after i graduated from college, i worked at one of the most well respected hospitals in the midwest region of the usa, which was associated with a very prestigious medical school. they had a large inpatient psychiatric unit. the consensus among the clinical staff (doctors and nurses) was that it was easy to tell who was associated with the psych unit, but it was not possible to tell the difference between the staff and the patients.   several years later, i was the chief operating officer of an acute care hospital located in a major metropolitan area of the southeastern usa. we had several psychiatrists on staff who admitted patients. we did not have a psych unit, they admitted them to a med-surg floor, where they were free to roam around and harass the staff and even other non-psych patients. imagine trying to explain to a bedridden patient and their family why it was ok for a psych patient who was floridly hallucinating to walk into their hospital room uninvited, and refuse to leave, until the psychiatrist showed up, which often took hours. for years, there was a steady stream of physicians - internists, cardiologists, surgeons, etc., who would come to my office and tell me that these psychiatrists were \"quacks\" and \"something must be done\" about them. but there was money to be made, so the corporation that owned the hospital kept letting them do it.   i know that's a long answer to your post, which i do truly appreciate, but i thought you deserved an explanation of why i have tried various therapists and have decided that my odds are better if i continue without their \"help\".   there are good psychiatrists, psychologists and counselors out there, and a good one can provide a huge amount of help. but you will probably have to walk out on several before you find one that is worth what you are paying them.@ same here. but it takes an awful lot of energy for me to be that angry, and i'm tired of it.@ > but i just try to keep looking forward. i know that doesn't really help, but i know how you're feeling in a way  actually, it does help. thanks.@ > is there something that you wanted to do or learn but felt you shouldn't waste your time or money on it? do you want to take some college classes and learn something just because it interests you? what brings you joy?  very insightful. i don't need to just sit around contemplating what i lost. i can fill many of those holes with meaningful, joyful things.@ thanks, i just need to focus on the present and future, not the past.@ good points. millions of christians waste their entire lives on stuff that doesn't matter, or does actual harm to themselves and others. christianity sucked the life out of many years, but i still have many years of life (hopefully) with which to find what it means to live life to its fullest.   thanks.\n",
      "yeah its like i spend everyday all day with this baby for the last 4 months. hes basically one of my limbs now. but yeah i must not have a clue when i tell its time for them to eat. you really want me to break it down for you cmon man just give me the baby what kills me is when they want to argue. it stirs something very primal in me not in a good way.@ i think they are just used to it. coming away from something so pervasive in your upbringing and in your life is really hard. its like being brainwashed it messes with your whole world view. i see tendencies of narcissism (for lack of a better word) in them but its just normal at this point. i have the same conditioning and im just now trying to make some strides in another direction because i was also doing it.@ source?@ youre damned if you dont damned if you do. if you dont announce people think its weird or that youre hiding it. if and when you do announce then you run the risk of having everyone know your business if something goes wrong. theres no right way but i do understand the annoyance of the sheer blissful ignorance of people who have obviously never had an issue with fertility. its like havent you at least even heard of a miscarriage?@ i asked my pediatrician about this he didnt offer unsolicited advice. he said that whether a baby can go through the night is dependent on their weight.@ how tf is a car or a kitchen gender specific?@ my siblings dont get it either and never have but it dawned on me the other day that regardless of how differently the treated us we still had the same messed up parents. they are probably used to it and cant see the parents behavior objectively. trying to come away from how you were conditioned your whole life is a mf@ hes 4 months ive been trying to night wean him. is that not usually recommended with attachment style parenting? his doctors office sent home a paper that said not to let them eat at night or they will never stop expecting deeds at night.@ damn what did your dad do to get blocked? just wondering.@ when i was around 10 or 11 i had noticed my dad was staring at my chest and trying to walk in on me getting dressed. it was really creepy and i guess it started showing in my behavior because i was becoming very withdrawn at school and defiant/emotional at home. she eventually took me to a psychiatrist who got me to talk about that almost immediately and wanted me to tell my mom. when i did she told me i was lying and that i had imagined it. so i just stopped talking about it because after this in the car she told me that i could get child services called and they would split us all up.  it wasnt until i was in my 20s that i began to realize that at the very least she could have asked a question if she didnt believe me. she could have looked a little closer if she hadnt noticed what i was talking about but she chose to ignore it.   at that time she truly had me believe that she didnt know what i was talking about. for a little while i was really confused and thought maybe i was imagining it. but unfortunately your dad gazing right at your tits and ass all the time is really hard to ignore.@ start changing in the bathroom after the shower so when you come out your fully dressed. sorry this is happening to you. its definitely fucked up and not in your head.@ i have 2 siblings and they both have different relationships with our parents. im the black sheep and thats our family dynamic so yeah it really sucks seeing people you love not even be aware of something like this@ ha you dont even know this person    lets take her baby because were in this guys side. theres 2 sides to every story i find it hard to believe that this guy is completely a victim.@ grey rock sounds interesting. dont worry, you will get away its crazy how fast your life can become so much better once you remove toxic elements. i will look more into grey rock.@ i just always worry that its cold or something idk..i guess im over thinking it@ omg everyone seems cynical as fuck. not the advice i was looking for at all. people have been splitting up since the beginning of time. does anyone have any self awareness or is this just a sub where we blame everyone else for our issues?@ like you said..if they dont like it then they should move somewhere more private. they chose to live in an apartment so they will have to make due.@ thank you that means a lot. happy thanksgiving if you live in the states :)@ im new to this but i read narcissistic parents are usually on one end of the spectrum. either they ignore you almost completely and make everything about them or they are involved in everything you do and try and control your life.@ why would i do that? they gave my baby covid because they were in denial. what kind of mother would i be if i let that kind of shit fly? rhetorical question.@ thanks for the advice. yeah my mom wanted me to give her credit for telling me that she couldnt taste or smell anything 2 hrs after she told me to bring him over. she never took accountability just went straight for the victim card. the silver lining of this is the i will be going to therapy as to not end up like them. holy shit @ i didnt trust them to begin with but didnt think they would fuck me over like this. i muted her texts. she text me all day yesterday and this morning inspire of me obviously ignoring her. just another example of them not respecting my boundaries.@ yeah they definitely seem like theyre trying to gaslight that fucked up thing is shes a nurse and my dad is a retired pa@ youre right. im having baby tested today. she keeps texting me asking if he has covid and it has taken every inch of will power for me not to tell her to fuck off and mind her own business. she keeps telling me she hopes he doesnt have it like~.no shit-i bet you do.@ if im being honest i never trusted them but my so convinced me that i was being too harsh. hopefully he gets it now!@ yes exactly! i dont plan to let them watch him anymore.@ do you even have kids?@ yeah for sure. im afraid to even start. dating apps are pretty intimidating and meeting new people during covid has to be damn near impossible.@ dont you resent them in your bones for trying to snatch your baby? i dont think i could ever get over something like that.@ what happens when you get so insanely bitter and scared to ever even try again?@ lol this made laugh. idk if it was meant to be funny but it reminded me of half baked.@ yes weve talked about it many times@ seeing as ive suggested therapy several times and nothing has happened~ill pass@ yeah it sucks. its really repulsive and off putting tbh. ive called him out on the porn thing in the past but like you said im at the point where im obviously not being heard so why bother.@ ouch i suppose youre right@ from what i understand this is usually a hormonal issue.@ you dont have to explain anything to me.@ that seemed like an overreaction.@ arent you guys afraid of suffocation? even the slightest chance of waking up to my baby not breathing is~there are no words.@ yeah its called stonewalling its a great predictor of divorce so theres that@ so im the perfect person to see this post because i had a problem with fertility due to progesterone. i started my 3rd pregnancy after 2 chemical pregnancies with progesterone supplements. i went in for an ultrasound at 5 wk due to spotting. a few days later i got the results which said i had a corpus luteum identified but that it was collapsing. in case youre not familiar the corpus luteum is what forms in a healthy pregnancy and sustains the developing fetus. i was diagnosed with a threatened misscarriage. my progesterone was eventually increased to the maxed dose but this wasnt before getting a (tmi) huge gush of blood and clots in my pants before a meeting one day. at this point i really thought it was over..again. i stopped taking my progesterone as frequently and just waited for it to pass like the other 2. but nothing was happening~so at my next appointment my hcg had tripled.   anyway i can tell you more about it if you want to message me. dont want this to get too long but the point of my story is that yes progesterone can and will stop a miscarriage if it is caused by low progesterone. 2.9 is pretty low but you have been prescribed progesterone so definitely keep taking them.  i had to go to a fertility clinic to be prescribed a really high dose but without it i wouldnt have my baby that im holding now   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.self.com/story/heres-why-khloe-kardashian-used-hormone-suppositories-at-the-beginning-of-her-pregnancy/amp  lastly heres an article i found while researching this subject while it was happening to me.   so yes as someone who has actually been there before progesterone can change your outcome dramatically. if this pregnancy doesnt make it which i really hope it does, i would definitely suggest a fertility clinic. they take the issue seriously and arent afraid to prescribe you the higher dose of progesterone, and will give you an us every week until youre close to 12 weeks.   ok im done now lol@ i know i need to leave him that was never the issue@ i think youre confused@ wow you sound like a happy, fun person to be around.@ why do you come to reddit to comment on peoples questions? because you are an expert on theirs?@  i feel like youre just projecting your own issues onto me. you dont even know me. you dont have pity for me? who says that to someone theyve never met? i have a whole entire life you know nothing about. it seems obvious. maybe you just need to get off the internet for awhile because you know you would never say this to my face.@ i just get annoyed when strangers start talking down to me. it almost seems like attacking me bc you think im weak and an easy target.@ youre so smart..im going to refrain from cussing you out because again idk you but you do seem like the kind of person who can dish it out and not take it so to speak.@ you dont know me or my situation in real life so dont talk down to me@ yeah he made the tinder 2 yrs ago. he told me she backed out but idk if thats true or if hes just saying that so that he doesnt have to admit he had sex with her. i broke up with him last week when i made the post about the sex toys but then things just went back to normal somehow.@ idk he does a lot for me. i think his love language is acts of service. i know everyone isnt the same and some have difficulty expressing themselves when theyre wrong. this is why i kept putting up with it bc nobody is perfect. but im tired of repeating myself. its hard for me to understand if he doesnt get what im saying or if hes just choosing not to understand.@ i dont want to at all. we are financially intertwined and have a baby@ im in too deep@ he insists hes not cheating anymore. i tried to forgive him bc this is his first relationship and i wanted to work things out. but when he acts like this it shows me he really doesnt care how i feel. i think he enjoyed watching me breakdown out if frustration from the gaslighting. he just kept picking on me by putting the vaseline in the shower.@ no but way earlier in the relationship i sent him a nude and then saw him send it to one of his friends. i just think at this point he knows ill take it. but i think im done.@ im not sure if they were nude but i bet if they could get one they would shat it. it was mainly things from social media but i really dont know. i think its really gross he says its not that big of a deal and it doesnt happen all of the time.@ thanks it means a lot to get advice from someone who has actually been through it.@ cool i bet you and your life are perfect. you feel sorry for a baby and a mil you dont know. thats how i know you have no life, probly no job and nothing to do but demean strangers on reddit. i dont want to read you but i will honey so do yourself a favor and dont respond to me.@ i just have an issue with the fact that she knew better but tried it anyway. she didnt ask she just waltzed in. the. she was talking about some of the clothes she bought being his first christmas outfit. i just dont feel like being gentle or making myself out to be the bad guy whether im right or wrong@ eventually i will tell her. but i dont have the energy rn and hoping she can yak a hint.@ thanks this is really good info. im going to skip getting a tablet for now. probably will stick with a laptop for convenience@ why do you think he didnt want to have sex anymore?@ everyone wants to have sex with me. im so arrogant. im the one that needs to be humbled. youre giving me self righteous advice and you dont know dick about me. are you intimidated by women. you dont even know me and youre toxic masculinity is oozing@ mmmyokay@ beta@ why would he make the first move? it would jeprodize his job and his career@ i need therapy but youre talking to me like you know me. as if you hold the answer to my situation yet you have no knowledge. honey maybe you should get into therapy. you really act like you know something when you know nothing. i bet people love you. the fuck?@ ok ill edit my statement bc thats not what happened@ im not kicking him to break his back..ok i nudged him with my foot is that better. also i have a baby that wakes me up every night. i dont want to hear him snoring while im trying to go back to sleep. also i nudge him every night this is just the only time hes ever been awake enough to notice.@ i realize this. the point to me is as an adult i dont want my fucking shot thrown away. i more so just wanted to share the fuckery of my situation and hear everyone elses response.@ he got mad when he found my dildo last yr. so i said id get rid of it. i didnt know it would be a problem. he went bat shit and kept taking it out of the trash or wherever etc. i guess he was salty. so i just kept it@ girl chill out thats not what i said and thats not whats happening@ the company says its a high density memory foam accepted by cpc and us safety guidelines.@ thanks that kinda what i thought but wanted to make sure@ consider throwing some things away to see if you can downsize the need for storage first. the handbags can probably be stored inside one another. do you have an office area where you can put some of that stuff or maybe discard some of it. you may be able to put a small dresser where those boxes are if you can figure that out and fold all of the clothes and put them in there. or leave the clothes hanging and use that space for something else or not at all.@  cool go through his phone and then get back to me on that.@ i chew his ass out all of the time. i would never tell him not to work overtime because thats work. going out to drink is a different thing but its like ok whatever i guess. but its the fact that he didnt care to wake up when the baby was crying and just stayed asleep until 11..   the whole point for me is that i dont want to still be explaining these things to him 6 years in.@ what about a baby?@ thank you@ thats all ive been trying to say! its childish to not think of others or simply take advantage of a situation that demand your presence. thank you!@ that means he thought it was your job to take care of the kids and not his@ to be honest i want to understand this point of view. i knew he would be out late by why does he have to sleep the entire morning? also i dont need another child i need an adult with common sense. i guess i was wrong for assuming he wouldnt sleep half the day  this is not the dynamic i want@ i think what youre saying has some valid points. its just difficult to see it being 100% of the reality of the situation. considering weve been together 6 years we should know each other pretty well. i think if i had communicated differently this situation wouldnt be happening but also why do i have to baby you and over explain everything every time? ideally he wouldnt have even asked me. i already said to him that i needed help. that seems like the worst time to be gone all day and sleep the rest of the next. to me it shows a deep lack of will to even consider what its like for me to be at home all day everyday with a baby while working. im not saying he shouldnt have time to be with friends but maybe not the day after i explicitly say something about needing help.@ it just seems kind of like common sense to me. he knows id like help and i told him the day before that i like when hes around to help. instead of working on saturday hes coming home late and sleeping the next day.@ its not like youre a fucking sex worker@ and die of dysentery@ also be considerate of what you really do need and what is just not necessary. only keep the essentials. you probably will be surprised by how many types on one thing you have like shampoo or conditioner. downsizing items is key. i also would suggest removing certain items from the bathroom all together. toilet paper and bath/shower essentials can go into a separate space along with towels if you have a closet or cupboard for those.@ theyre tired of your shit. youre a guest in their house. also just because you are doing something that seems nice doesnt mean your true intentions arent selfish. im not saying they were but bottom line, quit putting your jammy kid hands on all their nice sophisticated teas and items.@ when the person gets shot in the arm and falls down and dies immediately.@ made eye contact with me while licking one of those greasy rectangular pepperoni pizza pieces and said mmmm the grease is the best part   cannot remember what i said to him to deserve that@ so you are born multiple times through conventional sex. its actually a miracle that you exist at all even once. there are millions of sperm and you are the one that made it. theres no way that could happen more than once.@ how do you explain being a child and growing up?@ you know what helps me is not thinking and focusing on myself all of the time.@ i need a web redemption@ maybe youre bad at sex? do you finish too soon? do you do foreplay, are you good at it? have you ever thought maybe its me? in all sincerity it may have nothing to do with you but on the other hand maybe youre doing something wrong. she may not want to hurt your feelings by saying your dick is too small or that you have sex like youre in high school. but maybe shes just not interested in sex with anybody. on the other hand, if a guy who was really romantic and attractive and exciting was into her im sure she would want to have sex with him. for women foreplay often starts outside of the bedroom.   i say all this to say before you end the relationship by putting all the blame on her reevaluate what your part is in it. then again when youre done youre done and it may just be the best thing for everybody at this point. sorry if this came off as insulting i just dont know any other way to say it.@ nobody@ what a weird question@ yup im def not ok with it. i dont think hes listening because he has an arrogant personality. im not making excuses for him its just the fact of the matter. i dont know how to feel about it l. its more than frustrating its scary and conflicting. if i leave him then the baby will likely be with the father unsupervised for days due to shared custody.@ yeah you have a point. i dont think he means to neglect him he just doesnt understand that babies this age dont need to cry it out. he is very attentive and wants whats best for our son. hes just well..kinda clueless.@ break up with her. thats a huge red flag. how do you convince yourself to trust someone like that after they lie so extreme? you dont.@ thats a good idea. how do you suggest i say it?@ i pointed that out to him like how the hell is babying a baby a bad thing? def will put him on the spot at the pediatrician.@ yeah its been a long time coming. i have talked to him about it many a time. there been many calm discussions and flat out arguments.@ yeah i believe it. i called him out on all the hinge ads and he said we had been getting the ads which isnt true. he has a lock on his phone so its difficult for me to look through it. he told me he would take it off but to me that just says hell hide things better.@ i would record it and report him. you likely arent the first person he has done this to. its very illegal and he could go to jail for this. seriously if you dont then who will? the next girl?@ breakup with him!@ do you use dating apps or anything that would get you an ad like that? also i think the type of dating app is weird too. it feels oddly specific.@ lol yikes not good news at all. good luck with your coffee machine though.@ thats exactly what im worried about. im just unsure if thats exactly whats going on.@ shit for real? couldnt it just be based on ages range and activity on porn sites or something. im not sure what to think smh. dont want to confront him yet because still uncertain@ right i guess what make me suspicious is the amount of them in such a short period of time. this actually happened before. we got a ton of hinge ads for about a week until they stopped.\n",
      "i'm worried that's coming to my paper. no advertising lately~@ it's hard to be patriotic when bigotry is wrapped in the flag. my normie liberal parents have told me they feel disgusted when

for five years. not exactly a time in my life when i was trying to settle down, and i agonized over that sometimes. but i stuck it out because he's so worth it!   he is 5'8\" and a little on the chubby side, probably not a chad by your metrics. and i started dating him because he was smart and funny and we had similar interests and hobbies. i also love how much he cares about his friends, how he's a wonderful host and conversationalist, how much he values family and respects me and my values. you've decided that him being \"emotional support\" to me is betabux, even though we support each other. it sounds like you've decided a happy, fulfilling and healthy relationship is a failure, without ever experiencing it for yourself.   you try to fit our lives to your stereotypes and when they don't fit, you come up with reasons to dismiss it or assume you understand our psychology. you need to vomit up that red pill, man.@ how do you explain all the 50 year marriages and people who stay together till they die, then? why would human society have marriage if branch swinging was built in to us psychologically?@ if i'm after beta bucks then when am i supporting my boyfriend through college.@ they are successful. they wanted a girlfriend and they got one. you're the one with strange and dehumanizing expectations for human sexuality.@ you're assuming most men want to sleep with different women constantly after they're horny teenagers. i don't know that that assumption is correct. it's certainly not the case for most women, or for the men i've dated. but i guess people who

through 2022. if y'all want to defund them you should organize to do that now.@ thank you for that perspective. he made it seem like any editor would do what he'd do.@ one involves protecting the health and safety of innocents, the other is intended to suppress free speech. not wearing a mask isn't free speech.@ you have a lot of faith in the people of this county.@ you should be asking why our sheriff's deputies are willing to tear gas peaceful protesters and infringe on their first amendment rights, but aren't willing to enforce an order intended to save lives from a horrible illness.@ the sheriff's deputies in linn do a lot more than that.@ my whole office is full of people who don't care about the pandemic, if they even believe it exists. they're anti-maskers and refuse to obey our governor's recent covid orders. one even suggested a board game night and i just stared at her. so i guess i'm saying the culture of the office is to not recognize the death toll as something relevant or terrible.@ the other guy bailed on the ad, luckily. i need to get out of this shitty town.@ it's hard to say what would go viral, but i'm sure race is a part of it. the fact that they're at an orphanage doesn't help with it going viral either, as a lot of people will assume they are runaways.@ that was neat@ \"you are welcome to walk to your destination if you will not follow our rules for this flight.\"@ it's more than just the pandemic though. other countries chose to lock down their economies while keeping childcare and school open, which would allow more women to stay in the workforce. the u.s. hasn't done anything to help families in this pandemic, so the burden falls on women.@ /r/furry_irl@ that made me smile. she looks so happy!@ i feel like this video is unhelpful criticism, since she's just repeating what the critical tweet said but with more snark. but i think critiques of right-wing figures is valuable when they're more in-depth. i'm thinking of three arrows or shaun and their teardowns of the arguments. people get deradicalized by seeing that stuff, so i think it can be valuable. andy ngo is just a new kind of grifter- one who fakes being a journalist. he requires a different kind of takedown, probably.@ maybe sexually? but not as a lifestyle, unless they're extremely into that very rare kink. that's not the context of the conversation as written. bdsm stuff is pretty common, and the roles slightly skew towards traditional gender roles, but enough men are into submission and women into domination that it's hard to say it's a biotruf.@ is it just the cut on the bottom of your foot, or is it the toe too? and how deep is it? there are a lot of capillaries in the feet and hands, so a lot of blood isn't surprising.@ brown said during the press conference that law enforcement will actually be asked to enforce these measures this time. no more mrs. nice governor.@ del is good though!@ can you do it with average income?@ ok i read what you wrote. i will say you're sort of assuming all women are like the woman in that story, when they're not. red pill dudes have this great ability to only notice women who fall into the patterns they say, and they somehow ignore or are rejected by women who don't fall into those patterns. there are plenty of women out there who would be delighted to get flowers after a date. hell, my partner of 5 years handmade a bouquet of paper flowers for my birthday less than a month after we started dating and it charmed the pants off me. red pillers don't know about people like me because we don't date them.@ i haven't read what you wrote yet, but i read what you linked and it totally seems fake to me. no woman would say \"i want a man who would dominate me.\" that's not how women talk to men unless they're literally fucking. those field reports are usually made up imo.@ this racist kid needs a spanking.@ thank you!@ what's the context on nebraska?@ i'm so proud of oregon for keeping cases low. it's been so hard, though.@ i've been getting so much useless furniture!!@ turns out only airbuds and his children, the airbuddies, are allowed to vote. it's the dog version of the fucked up grandfather clause.@ there's exactly as much evidence of that as there is of the democrats stealing the election.@ so yummy!@ that's so cool! perfect for a modern witch @ this is so adorable! grandma quilts are the best. my grandma made one for me with a little character from my favorite children's book.@ that's how you know it's well sourced@ i think we do similar to utah, as far as the business side enforcement goes. they caught dozens of businesses and fined them in august. i would support police going after parties and stuff, but i'm not sure whether rural areas would accept it or whether their police departments would enforce it. i mean, we all saw the video of a state trooper saying \"fuck the governor\" when asked to put on a mask. that's who we're relying on to enforce stuff if it goes to personal gatherings.@ they've been assaulting people in salem, or- pepper spray, beatings, stealing shit to provoke people. cops didn't do shit. but it wasn't declared a riot- the peaceful blm protest was.@ i say \"owed\" because it's implied when you say \"ripped off.\" you are ripped off when you don't receive something you are owed. i don't know why you're so worked up about other people's divorce proceedings, but you may want to consider how those determinations are made. consider: a man marries a woman and asks her to be a stay at home mom while he works. she does so, giving up the career and training she would have pursued otherwise for 8 years. she later finds out he is cheating, and they get a divorce. the judge says he owes her alimony because she isn't able to support herself the way she would have without their marriage because she took on the burden of child rearing while he didn't have to sacrifice his career. does this situation suck? yes. is it a rip-off? no. one or both of them is getting screwed over either way, by virtue of developing a life together and then having to suddenly separate and live independently.@ i find it interesting that you can only speak in vague metaphors and insults without giving actual examples of your beliefs. what are the hoops you're talking about? and there's a difference between rights and a gift. black people should have the same right to live unmolested by police, but they don't and they're  over incarcerated and murdered as a result. the right of a free existence is so unlike a \"shitty toy at christmas\" that it's truly laughable you couldn't think of a better metaphor.@ enforcement is through osha and olcc. i'm not sure how she could enforce private gatherings. what would you suggest?@ beehive station is a great place for foodcarts, and the indian truck there is delicious. i also really liked happy bibimbap house downtown. tons of great asian markets out by lancaster@ when you say \"deal with this,\" what are you referring to, specifically? you say a lot about feeling ripped off. what exactly is ripping you off? what do you feel owed that you're not getting, and why do you feel entitled to it? please think carefully about it and respond concisely.@ oregon is in fourth for states doing the best at keeping covid cases down. we're so lucky to have her and people just shit on her constantly. it's not like she wants to make people stay home and not see their families. she's trying to save our lives. my family just cancelled thanksgiving plans because of her, and i'm upset but also grateful that we're willing to listen to science and protect each other.@ please also consider getting some help for your compulsion for self-harm. you can overcome it, i promise. @ what's the problem with the current liberal narrative on women's rights, bud? do we deserve less than you?@ using the term \"feminized men\" is another great example of trp behavior- thanks for bringing that up!@ that was a bot, dude.@ i've honestly lost the thread of your argument, but i'll just say i don't see anyone encourage cheating. that's really uncommon, at least in my part of the world. people who cheat are typically ostracized or seen to be scumbags, regardless of gender. if you've been cheated on, i'm very sorry that happened to you. i do think you're assuming it's more common than it actually is, though. https://psychcentral.com/blog/how-common-is-cheating-infidelity-really/@ cheating is bad, i agree. but i wasn't \"being used\" when i consensually slept with other single people and enjoyed it. i was enjoying my sexuality and my life. you've decided that all sex is exploitative or harmful unless it's in a committed relationship. i can tell you i've had exploitative sex in a committed relationship and i've had free and enjoyable sex while single. you seem to think i would fit a stereotype while sleeping around- that i would say \"why can't i find a good guy?\" but i actually wanted casual sex myself and only incidentally found a relationship. in a more free society where sex isn't viewed as a commodity, it becomes more acceptable to pursue all kinds of connections and let things develop naturally. i don't see a problem with that.@ i don't really see why you went off on this tangent, but i do want to know- why do you feel hurt when women choose to sleep around? why does it not hurt you similarly for men to sleep around? in what way does a woman sleeping around make her unpalatable as a future partner? because there is no social or biological reason for that unless you see women's value as tied to their virginity, but not men's. i slept with a dozen people of different genders before settling down with my partner, and those experiences actually made me a better partner and lover. he's not offended by my past because he sees me as a human, not as a used up sex toy. what a fuckin concept.@ a great way for them to collect the identities of the right people to suppress and target for \"law enforcement\"@ it's gotten a lot better since the recession, to be fair. i grew up there and hated it but it's a lot better now.@ my favorite thing about autumn is watching the leaves change!@ you call women plates and think our value is determined by how many people we've slept with. i don't think there's a form of feminism compatible with that kind of dehumanization, and it's a stench any feminist can sniff out very quickly.@ do they deserve less pay than an equally incompetent man? i really don't see what gender has to do with it.@ it's the truth that women deserve less pay? you're proving my own point.@ you're reading into it more than the comedian who said it.@ no, he said that's why women deserve to be paid less. he doesn't extrapolate similar views to all men when men kowtow to trump. when his joke is that sexism is deserved because of the actions of one woman, he's being sexist.@ i feel like you're reading into it way more than most of his audience does. that was the one joke i found tasteless.@ urbanism! subbed instantly.@ winco bulk spices are cheap af@ this is disgusting.@ i don't really see how this is news at this point. has anyone even called it?@ /r/theydidthemath@ a nut is a male orgasm, so this implies santa is coming in your mouth.@ welcome to munch squad@ that is some powerful energy@ those look so good!@ maybe all the bis should just date each other!@ having a meaningful relationship with a man and then identifying as a lesbian doesn't invalidate your prior relationships or say you never had real feelings. it just means you only want to date women moving forward!@ i've slept with many men and enjoyed it, though i enjoyed it differently from with women. i felt crushed on boys and girls from a young age, boys more than girls (tho some turned out to be queer, haha). i actually joined this sub while going through a rough time in my long-term relationship with a guy where i can't really enjoy penetrative sex, and i started wondering if i became a lesbian. i'm still on the fence sometimes but i think i appreciate male anatomy enough that i'm clearly not 100% gay. it sounds to me like you are.@ thank you!@ haha thank you!@ i wanted to tell you that you helped me give this plant new life and it's way happier since you id'd it for me!@ you should go to the doctor if you haven't already. you have more symptoms than first aid on the internet can help with.@ yeah, but i seem to remember griffin talking about it like his character isn't interested. so it's still pretty fucking terrible to continually put him in awkward positions just because travis has a favorite npc.@ that's why the whole war thing is fucked. he keeps pushing them to go to war when all of them are peace boys who don't wanna kill anyone. did he really expect them to just go along and accept having a horde of the dead and futures that are horrifying?@ especially since- isn't fitz ace?? i mean pushing the ship is just fucked at this point@ he used to be good but he's lost the thread.@ does he seriously think he comes off looking good from that exchange? what a nut.@ i'm not sure he's right-wing, but he's often on fox news and he plays into right-wing narratives and misinformation fairly often.@ he's been sliding for years. he recently tweeted that he considers silence from a source to be confirmation of his allegations. absolutely ridiculous.@ i feel the same way. i aspire to be people who are too old to be in my dating pool, and even then it's just that i admire their careers. i like who i am.@ i think his land value tax is a good solution for cities that aren't building enough to meet rental demand, but it doesn't necessarily deal with the problem of overpriced homes for prospective homeowners.@ no, it's not. it was created by trolls on 4chan and is now used to convince people like you that democrats need to be killed because they're pedophiles, instead of engaging with your political opponents within the framework of our democratic society. it's a cult and it's a danger to our society and civil liberties. @ thank you so much for getting into so much detail and giving so many recommendations!@ ok qanon, calm down.@ blood turns black when it dries. keep it clean, put antibiotic ointment on it and you should be fine. it doesn't look that deep.@ biden will absolutely tear gas your mom lol. he's not a leftist, he's a fucking neoliberal. i'm voting for him but let's not pretend he's some savior when he's not.@ i recommend dating women then! that's just what the doctor prescribed.   two ccs of tiddy, stat!@ if you're still a teenager, i would say it's too early for you to decide fully one way or another. just keep doing you and you'll figure out if you actually like men or not. it's possible you are nervous about sex in general, and would feel similarly with women. it's also possible you are a lesbian. but it's a fun time to explore your identity without committing fully to defining yourself! i wouldn't sweat it.    i'm speaking as a bi woman in my mid-twenties who didn't get to explore my sexuality until college. then i was able to figure out that i did indeed like both. but it's no rush to determine your feelings as of yet, especially if you are willing to accept yourself either way.@ i'm in the exact same situation as a bi girl. i've even preferred videos aimed at gay men since those videos at least show people being pleasured, and the dudes are hot.@ there are all kinds of video production/content jobs that aren't journalism, including with government agencies.@ it's even harder to find lesbian porn aimed at women. i don't want to see a woman with claws for nails wiggle the other girl's clit until she fakes an orgasm. i want to see them genuinely enjoy themselves. maybe men can't tell the different but we can.@ i'm in a professional job where i make $200 more a month than would qualify me for the local medicare expansion in my state, even if i married my partner who's a student and doesn't work. so i just don't have insurance and hope i don't have to get health care.@ thank you for your perspective. i'll handle it delicately- i don't want to make things worse by any stretch.@ thank you for sharing this article. i definitely have one coworker who considers it to just be a phase, so maybe i'll talk about the mental health/emotional support thing with him. i'm glad your mom came around!@ how old were the kids when they got adopted?@ the sleeves are a really nice touch!@ yes it's democratic socialists of america@ this is so sweet! you're a good neighbor.@ this weekend, when i helped a guy reunite with his family for the first time in 20 years.@ yeah, it's mostly a thing on twitter that conservatives get worked up about.@ if a giant internet company can't manage to create a proper video player and also doesn't allow much video embedding, it's not that strange to criticize it. they make millions and millions of dollars on us and can't even put together a useable product.@ i agree on all points and i typically really like natalie. i wish she had talked about more than the presidential election and i wish she hadn't gone so far with straw-manning. it's a lot more common for people to be accelerationist than to just go \"revolution now,\" and i would really have enjoyed seeing her take down that real rhetoric than something leftists don't actually say.@ god i fucking hate the reddit video player. it always pauses right in the middle of the video and then i have to click through to the post.@ this is weird as hell and i think they might be a content farm. how much are they having you write per week?@ i'm 26 now and i'm cis, but in high school i really wished i'd been born a boy. i still feel like my life would have been easier that way, but i identify as cis now. there's nothing wrong with you either way, and i think exploring your feelings is probably the best way to come to a happy conclusion, rather than repressing them. hopefully that will be an easier thing to do, now that you're graduating!@ thank you! i was on a bike while i was listening so i couldn't write it down and i didn't want to dig through the episode for it. cool as heck! she deserves to use the teeth.@ i love that stunned laugh right after he lands the big jump!@ if only that money actually came out of the police budget or their salaries, instead of it just being taxpayer money.@ yeah, her leg is definitely broken. that bottom foot should not be angled like that. right?@ what country? i'm sure there are domestic violence shelters, maybe you can call.@ i agree with other commenters saying you should correct the record with the newspaper by contacting the editor in chief directly. you can also look for other local outlets- a paper in a nearby town, or a local radio or tv station. they might be able to cover the story if this paper is actually as unethical as you think. but more likely, the paper made a mistake and will gladly rectify it and will be very sorry.@ thank you!!@ you only pay alimony if you marry a housewife. a lot of these sexist dudes insist their wife shouldn't work, but don't want to actually be responsible for her. it's disgusting.@ my only issue is him getting after brad's pronunciation of \"foreign\" words. truth be told, brad can't pronounce anything.@ the reason you shouldn't do it yourself is because you can't clean it well enough yourself or give yourself the correct drugs to prevent infection.@ do not close it yourself if you're not medically trained as it could increase the chance of infection. do another deep cleaning and irrigate it super well (look up a guide, you should use a dental syringe or similar for increased power). i think you could then probably use antibiotic ointment and keep it clean and covered. if you don't go to the doctor it will scar worse, but you may be ok. monitor closely for signs of infection like red around the wound or heat coming off it.@ it could get infected and be very very bad. where on your body is this, how deep is it, and how old is the injury in this photo?@ as a bi in an ltr with a dude, i am cry now@ @ oh yes! fixed!@ i agree on the horizontal stripes looking good. maybe mix all the colors up instead of it being a gradient? that way there's no implied heirarchy.@ you would want to use a dressing because you want it to stop it permanently, not just while your hand is on there.@ his art was detailed but the ideas behind it were always angst about how horny he was. lame af. if you want a surrealist with empathy for women, try renee magritte.@ renee magritte's piece the treachery of images was just one of many works he created to \"hollow out poetic verse.\" i rather like \"ceci est un morceau de fromage,\" which is a painting of a painting of a piece of cheese in a glass display case. magritte is my favorite artist because his work always aimed to make you question reality and question art. his later work gets more subtle, with meticulously painted images of buildings which are cast in day and night simultaneously- lit as if by night, but with bright blue skies above. @ @ it looks like . you may want to see a doctor.@ it doesn't look infected. is there redness or any heat coming off it?      did you maybe cook with vinegar recently? lol@ you are nta and a lot of salons do that extra stuff for free, usually to try and sell you the product they use on your hair. don't feel guilty at all for not rejecting it at the time she started doing it@ i would probably try to freelance to get clips and develop relationships. but also keep in mind that the job market for journalism sucks right now, so they can be insanely picky. i just got a fucking graduate degree in journalism after working in large cities as a reporter for several years and the best job i could get is in a tiny rural town community newspaper. it is tough out there and it's not your fault.@ now i'm crying at work. she was a legend.@ that is true, but he showed up in 12 seconds in game time, which is absurd. when called out by griffin on it, travis just said \"do you really want to go 12 more rounds?\"@ i like that aspect of it too, and i honestly think combat is the most boring thing about dnd. combat should be high-stakes, meaningful, and plot driven, and shouldn't be the main focus of a campaign. here it feels like a flaccid side salad to the main story rather than an integrated part of it.@ absolutely!@ when travis was saying he had too high of stats, i was like \"this reflects more on the dm than the player.\" rogues are really, really good at one thing, and you should take that away from them as the dm!@ these are so cute! thank you very much for providing a tutorial. i might try these decorations on a cake!@ i just don't like them cause i don't like the taste of pumpkin. are there places that just use the spices without the pumpkin flavor?@ i agree about not expecting sex. try to think of dating as a good time getting to know people, not a means to an end. if you're desperate to get your dick wet, that will come across and make the person you're on a date with feel used.@ agreed with all of these, but for the ignoring your texts thing, give them a little more leeway than few hours, especially if they're at work. if it's days, that's a lot more questionable, but i think neediness in texting is a red flag in itself.@ it looked like the shoulder, not the neck!@ those ones are so cute!@ i'd be super worried about anonymous editors taking my ideas and assigning them in-house. some editors do that anyway, but you at least know they burned you. in this situation, the anonymity would make it way easier for the editors to steal pitches.@ that number is only for the odfw office in fern ridge. direct inquiries about other areas to the regional odfw numbers.@ if it didn't go over well with her, you can probably talk to her about it and salvage the friendship. it sounds like she's not that into you.   the way you talk about this, though, makes me worry that you'd be okay with \"forcing\" other things on her as well. she might be thinking the same thing, depending on whether you cornered her or if you were pushy or she was drunk. she may trust you less if you crossed boundaries to fulfill your own desires despite what you knew were her own. only you can really decide if it was worth it.@ what did you actually do? your post is extremely vague.@ start a podcast or get involved in one! you might even be able to to it through your paper, like a weekly news round-up or something.@ if it's not even public, how are new writers gaining exposure by working with you?@ you should try to get explanatory clips. if you're only writing stories that are just 250 words or less, you're not really covering context or explaining things that may be unclear to the layman.@ thank you. i was sick of seeing students fall for that shit.@ both, i'd say. you should be honest with people you try to date/get close to. i don't mean that you should say it on the first date or even the fifth date. but if you start getting to the girlfriend/boyfriend stage and have been there for a few months, then you should be more honest about your past and who you are. if they can't handle that vulnerability, they're the wrong person for you to date anyway.      i wanted to get that advice to you since you're inexperienced and because you're in this sub, but in most non-redpill relationships, you slowly build intimacy by sharing vulnerable details with each other and growing to trust each other with those hidden parts of you. it's really magical to accept someone for everything they are and for them to accept you the same way. it doesn't always work out, and sometimes you get hurt, but it's completely worthwhile. and in your particular case, it's key to date someone you can trust with this information. if you get triggered or anything and react unpredictably, they should know what is going on ahead of time and they may be able to help you get back to normal.@ if you end up in a serious relationship you'll want to be honest eventually, though. it'll be suspicious to be hiding it if they ask.@ thank you!@ i would love set 2! i spent some time helping a young person in my field improve her resume today, and i might be able to get her an internship if i work on my boss just right!  college advice: you should see if you can join clubs dedicated to your interests. there are tons of people who love anime and i'd bet every college has a club for that. you'll immediately make friends if you check out a bunch of clubs! don't worry too much about vibing in the dorms or with classmates, though. i have like 2 real friends from the dorms 6 years after graduating. if it works, it works! if not, it's not the end of the world and says nothing about you.@ that cop puts his fucking hand on his gun at 5:52 when he goes to his pocket for the phone. fucking ridiculous how much they escalate a situation.@ have you heard of the blm protests and how police crack down on them? that's why. they shut down the protest i was at and they chase you when that happens.@ i am so, so sorry this happened to you. you didn't deserve it, and that woman was 100 percent in the wrong. you're a good husband and a good person- that's why the salesperson stayed to help you out. they didn't kick you out, they removed her. nta.@ was that in the english translation? i watch it with subs and he calls her a slut, but i think that's the extent of it.@ happy birthday! i have a foolish question- how do you get stuff to be in the middle of a table if it's outside?@ you did a truly fantastic job! i aspire to be on your level!@ it might be the laundry detergent, thank you!@ you're asking an online community and hearing the opposite. are you sure it's feminist saying those things and not the commentary of right wingers?@ ahhh sorry, i get it@ that's how i felt about jay! congrats on being rid of a villager you don't like. what is katt's vibe?@ then they're transphobic and aren't good feminists. intersectionality means accepting all kinds of identities. your identity as a trans man doesn't mean you're opposed to women's rights, it means you've found a more comfortable way of existing in your skin. ignore those jerks!@ as far as i know, sohla is the only one who said she didn't want to make videos. i think all of them wanted to be paid fairly for it and left when that didn't happen- it wasn't necessarily that they hated being on camera.@ that would be such a betrayal to the people who worked so hard for change while staying loyal to bon appetit.@ i'm so glad you stayed out of it! i hope things start looking up for you soon.@ you did a great job. i also felt guilty that i may have done something wrong after i helped some folks in a car crash. after a while i realized i probably experienced some mild emotional trauma from witnessing/experiencing it. don't feel guilty, you helped a ton and may have saved that cyclist's life!@ very true. i wasn't still in contact with my ex when he reached out, but it still meant a lot.@ that's true, but i also think it can be really beneficial to have a conversation with the people you hurt who you're still close to. tell/show them you've grown by saying what you did was wrong and why you've changed your thinking, and apologize. i really think it can mean a lot for people to hear that, speaking as someone who had an ex apologize for shitty behavior years after the fact.@ order breakfast from addi's in springfield, get dinner at izakaya meiji, and you can do a great hike at sweet creek falls if you're willing to drive. stay safe!@ that corn flake one is raw for sure.@ is it mizzou? i went there. it's good for tv producers, but i'll tell you there's no way in person classes will actually keep going there. the virus is spreading a lot in that county and i'm sure it'll get shut down.@ you should listen to reply all's episode long distance: the real alex martin. i think you shouldn't promise money, but instead try to be friendly with the scammer to get them to open up to you. you might have to try a couple times, but it could be interesting. offering them money is unethical, in my opinion, and also makes you a target for them to scam.@ this is wrong, jay sucks and i can't wait to throw him off my island@ maybe that explains legoshi's fur color compared to juno's?@ he was the louis to your haru, but you'll find a legoshi who would kill for you someday@ my boyfriend is super opposed to cottage core because he sees it as a far-right thing, so i'm glad to see more evidence that my bisexual ass is welcome in the aesthetic community@ you're a good person. thanks for thinking about other people!@ i love this.@ nah i'm just jokin lol@ the bridge of your nose is the best indicator of your chosen gender. when people get transitional surgery it's usually to manage their nose bridges.@ hell yeah, washington is super close to being 100% renewable. nuclear is 8% and wind is another 5.6%, so coal and lng only account for about 8% total!@ and if someone gives you a thoughtful gift, it makes you feel like the most special person in the world.@ cool, thank you!@ i was gonna say, there have been three non-binary people diagnosed in oregon.@ this is a great story, congratulations! you've got a bright future ahead of you, i'm sure of it. be sure to include this link in your college applications!@ somethings seems to have shot up my pant leg, and i don't think it was a part of my soft fabric shoe. that's why there's a continuous line kind of up my shin. thanks for the info, i appreciate it. any contaminants i should be particularly worried about?@ why would anyone apply butter or toothpaste? is that a thing?@ nope! though i might get the chance to grab one of things keep going how they're going.@ there's not really big chunks stuck in my or anything, the black residue appears to be from the explosives in the device. i cleaned a bit more of it off yesterday after taking this photo, but some of it is stubborn and i've left it.@ are bandaids sufficient?@ the device exploded directly on top of my foot, blowing out my shoe and sending more explosive bits up my pants leg. we had to walk several blocks after that as police chased us, but i was able to run cold water on the burns after about 10 minutes and try to clean it with one bottle of water. an hour later i was able to run more water on it and clean it more, though black stuff remains on the worst burns. i've been keeping it covered with bandaids and neosporin. advice?@ wasn't she doing there work with you that you're counting as your chores? so those hours count for her side of it as well.@ look, i see posts all the time saying \"it's not my burden to educate people on my life experience.\" so i didn't want to go find an indigenous activist to harass them for info, so i thought i'd ask a group that i've seen being really intersectional about it. i don't understand why asking a question about something is problematic in this context. what indigenous sources do you want me to learn from? can you show me the resources you're talking about?@ i asked the question because i wanted to learn more about it, not because i wanted to lead a discussion. is there an \"ask indigenous\" subreddit i should have gone to?@ so what would the turnover look like? can only native people be elected to government, but everyone can vote?@ part of the reason i asked this question is because of how leftists reacted to seattle's chaz early on. they were saying the land taken from police in the middle of seattle should be given back to indigenous peoples. if that's the goal, what is the role of other races in a new society in america?@ a lot of tribal governments have extreme issues with corruption, though. what would it look like to disenfranchise every other race?@ thank you so much for sharing this! i didn't know the origin of the term. i wholeheartedly agree

have any black cosmos or blue roses?@ i think this is a good document from you to work from as you write the main story, but that amount of exposition all at once isn't very exciting. i think if you

      "when my depression kicks in, i do the same thing.    lots of naps and binge-watching netflix series.  covid is not only killing people from the disease itself, but also causing widespread depression and relationship failures.@ this is both hilarious and sad at the same time.    if it were only that simple.  to therapist:  and here is your $150 for that hour of great advice :(@ yep.   same thing for me, but alcohol.   i don't drink 24 hours a day.  but, i can't wait for 5pm to roll around.@ covid ?    i know that covid isolation has had a big part in my depression.   i have been depressed for several years now.  but, it is really bad this year.@ yep.   i have a really good life.   great job.  no stress.  married my best friend.   and yet, i had completely lost interest in everything for most of this year.  4 months ago i started taking wellbutrin, after already taking paxil for many years.   it has definitely helped.     while i am not ready to take on the world, at least i have some interest in my hobbies again (guitar/music) and i would rather live than die at this point.  i have never been suicidal, just indifferent when it comes to the concept of death.    i do think covid has a large part in all of this.    i am an extrovert and really miss people while having to work from home.@ not saying that women don't have it worse, because they do.   but, there are crazies in both sexes.  i have had 2 female stalkers in my life that made it a living hell for a short while each time.   i never dated either of them or showed any interest at all.   one was a work related relationship like ops.    that stalker cost me one relationship as my gf at the time was too freaked out to date me anymore.    i had to quit that job, move and delist my number to get away from her.  good luck op.    that is a really bad situation.   but, you have so much good advice in this thread.@ i have been on paxil for many years.   my depression has been increasing over the last few years, especially with covid and the current political climate.   i have never been suicidal.  but, i really didn't care if i died.   i tend to suffer from anhedonia, which is the inability or difficulty feeling pleasure.   i have a great life with little or no pressures.   i just feel tapped out on living sometimes.  buproprion has helped.  while it has added some minor anxiety back in my life, i also feel more alive and can find pleasure in many things again.   it's not a complete transformation.  but, things are better.    i have been on bupropion for a little over 3 months now i believe.@ i added bupropion to hopefully give me more sexual sensitivity, taken away by paxil.  i don't think it has helped much in a sexual manner (maybe a little).   however, it has given me more energy and helped with my depression, which had been getting increasingly worse over time (especially with covid).     fwiw, i have not lost any weight on buproprion.   but, i work out a lot and stay pretty consistent  anyway.@ reading these posts has made me paranoid.    i have been on bupropion for 2 months.       this article might help.  https://www.verywellmind.com/q-does-wellbutrin-cause-hair-loss-3972820@ agree.   i am a long time paxil user and started buproprion 3 months ago.    i probably still need the paxil for anxiety and panic attacks.   but, the buproprion has helped with my depression and lack of motivation.   unfortunately, it hasn't really helped with the paxil sexual side effects.   but, i have been on it a long, long time.@ they were trickle truths regarding the 1 affair.     she didn't want to talk about it initially because she said it would make me angry.   i told her that i was already hurt and needed to hear the entire story.   it took about 2 or 3 months, but eventually i heard everything about the affair.  all the details.   her point afterwards was that she learned a lesson and that our relationship could grow stronger because of it.    but, i will never have the same level of trust again.   and, she still lets guys get too close imo@ hmm.    to be honest, she is and would be terrible at affairs.    she often forgets things and leaves evidence all over.  but, lying is a big problem for her.  after catching her, i told her that things would have been far better if she had told me the truth, instead of me finding out the way i did.    my trust would be so much better if it worked that way.    of course, she said that she was close to telling me and was waiting for the correct time.   i want to believe that.   but, i really don't.  she thinks that because she eventually opened up about everything, i should trust her.   but, it was like pulling teeth to get all the facts.  in fact, she went out of town with a girlfriend for a weekend at the time she met the guy.  her and her gf did in fact meet and go out of town eventually.    but in between her leaving our house and heading out of town, she met up with the guy all day.  how did i find out that she actually met him, when she said it was an online affair only ?  i ended up finding out the truth when i found a gas station receipt from a location 15 miles from our house in the opposite direction, when she was supposed to be 200 miles away.    so many lies.   she says that she didn't tell me because of my anger issues.   but, its hard to be angry when your heart is completely broken at the time.@ i have been in therapy myself following the affair.   unfortunately, she moved away and it is hard to find good therapists, especially these days.     both my wife and i mentioned wanting to go to counseling.   covid is making it very difficult though.   i guess we will have to settle on zoom sessions or other online means.     i feel very used and that is what leads to the bitterness.@ \" her age may have her questioning her life and now she is exploring options. \"  i have brought this up to my wife.   i have said that if she  feels unfulfilled and can be happier elsewhere, please leave and i can at least respect you and love the times we have had.   but, i cannot stand liars and cheaters.    i would never stand for another affair, regardless of the situation.@ i have made the same point to my wife many times.   early in our relationship, she was very suspicious of friends that i had who were woman.     so, i call her hypocritical at times for grilling me about guys crossing the line in pm's to her.  she knows that i am loyal.  i  never lock my phone or social media and i am always open about things.   if i get hit on by a woman, i tell her and she usually laughs about it.    i have had some crazy things happen also when out with friends.   so, she feels secure with me.   i just wish that i had the same level of respect.     i am fine with her having male friends.   but, if those friends ever try and cross the line, which many/most will do, i feel disrespected and rightfully so imo.    she is a married woman.    at that point i feel she should shut down their friendship or at least make a statement.     good luck to you.@ that i have anger issues, question her decisions and try and control her.    i do have anger issues that i have received help with.    i do question her decisions sometimes, when i am 100% they are wrong (and almost always backfire on her).    i don't try and control her.  but, she grew up with controlling parents and so she is terrified of anyone trying to control her.@ yep.   this morning i showed her something from a marital expert as far as taking 100% responsibility for an affair.     her response was \"who exactly are they ?\", \"i don't know their exact qualifications\", \"what gives them a right to make that statement\".  she discredits all my sources, but yet watches experts on youtube and takes them as absolute truth.    it is gaslighting, which she also knows a lot about.@ thanks.  appreciate you taking the time to give your thoughts.@ great points.   thanks.@ thanks.   she has recommended counseling.  but with covid, it has been an nightmare trying to get an appointment.    many of them will do counseling over zoom.   but, i don't think that will work for us.     i know that both sides are responsible when relationships start to fail.   so, i am also responsible for that.    but, i care enough to not disrespect her.@ \" so, what are you gonna do about it? \"  this is what i am wrestling with right now.    we have been in fights before when i said i was leaving.   but, i was usually drunk and changed my mind when i sobered up.  this time feels different.   when i voice my frustrations, she says that all this negativity is happening because of covid and being around each other 24/7.  i actually do think a trial separation might help clarify things.   the problem is that she won't leave the house and i need a super high speed internet location to be able to work from home.       maybe a separation will clarify things for her also.   i don't want to be married to a person that does not love or respect me.    she says that she does.  but, her actions say otherwise.@ unfortunately, because of covid all the therapists in my area are either booked up or not taking appointments :(  your point is valid.   i just wonder if there is any man or woman that would accept this kind of behavior from their spouse, unless they just wanted a trophy wife and/or would accept an open relationship.  btw-i would not want an open relationship and my wife says that she does not either.@ thanks.  i agree she loves the attention.   she says that she is not narcissistic and she study's up on narcissism every day because of her 2 moms that raised her.  but, it seems pretty narcissistic to me to put your own feelings ahead of the impact your actions may have on your spouse.@ thank you.  by \"messing around\" she means they kissed and got handsy.   my wife will not have intercourse with anyone, unless there is a long history.    it doesn't matter anyway, because as i told her, meeting someone behind my back with intent is worse than getting drunk and fucking someone.     \" she effectively told him that when she had the affair. \"  while this was going on she was following ester perel and making comments about how it is possible to love 2 people at once.   i had no idea at the time what she might be alluding to.@ i know that i crave her because she is my wife and i am loyal.   and yes, she is super attractive.    guys hit her up and facebook and send her inappropriate text messages almost daily.   it gets really old.  personally, i think she gets off on it and it feeds her ego, because she doesn't shut them down right away.   i honestly don't think her sex drive has been very high ever since she  started on topomax 3 years ago.   the affair was right after that (she had no sex).   she feels great on that drug, but it has changed her personality into someone less loving and cold.   she see's it as directness.  i see it as cold.  since taking the medication 3 years ago, she has not been the woman i married.  i love sex of course.   but, i miss the intimacy and touch more.   i have to be the one to hug her or rub her head or hold her hands.  needless to say, we are struggling right now.    she says that i had something to do with the affair.   both parties are guilty when there are relationship problems.    but as any therapist will tell you, cheaters are 100% responsible for their own actions.   instead of feeding their ego by having an affair, they could have got counseling or even ask for a divorce before cheating.   they are selfish escapists.  i resent her for not taking full responsibility for the affair.    things are just not good right now and for the first time i am considering the d word.   i won't rush the decision.   maybe a trial separation would work better.   i think if i was out of the house maybe she would see what she is missing.     the problem is she wont leave the house.  a nd, i have a bunch of high end it equipment in my house that i need for my job.    i don't  think i could run this business out of an apartment.@ i am currently in a mostly db situation after 10 years (sex every 2 or 3 months).    i absolutely cannot orgasm, unless i am thinking about my wife.   i have tried to masturbate to thoughts of other women, just to see if i can do it.   if i watch porn (rare), i replace the woman on the screen with my wife.   so, not all men want shiny new things.   sometimes it is the women who want shiny new things.     interesting that you let your husband sleep with other women.    my wife had a brief emotional fling (online only) about 3 years ago.    she thinks it would be helpful for both of us if i slept with someone else one time.    most men would probably jump at the opportunity.   it just doesn't work for me.        fwiw, she does not want an open relationship.    she just thinks that i should have a night of sex, because that might equalize things and get rid of some of my resentment.    and of course, she does not want to feel pressured about sex and says if i do that it makes her not want to have sex even more.    i very rarely bring up the db and complain about.     i am sorry you are going through this op.   but, the relationship sounds past the point of no return.   you will find a man to make you happy.@ did she work her way through college, or did her parents fully support her ?    some people just don't have a strong work ethic.     my wife of 10 years has flipped between so many careers since we have met.   if she makes any profit at all, it is usually extremely minimal.    her idea of working hard is a 15 hour max work week.   she says it is because her work is either physically or mentally hard.    i worked 60+ hour weeks for the first 9 years of our marriage.    i admit that i get resentful at times and it can be a problem in a relationship.     and no, she is not a housekeeper either.   we hire one to clean the house :(      if this is a concern of yours, it could be a deal breaker down the road and the resentment will only grow.  trust me on this.@ almost no side effects for me.    the first 24 to 48 hours are probably going to feel a little strange to you as your body adjusts.     after a day or two, i settled in nicely with no real side effects.   my anxiety is a little higher.  but, that is probably because i feel more alive and less depressed.@ great post.  op, now is not the time to make a big decision that will impact the rest of your life.     so very sad.@ i figured that would happen eventually.    at least you will have each other now.@ i know that people have downvoted you.   but, what you said is true.   i have had it and so has my wife.    we still wear a mask around other people out of respect.   and, i do think that people should be safe when possible.    but, if you are low risk and a loved one needs your care, i would go for it also.@ i would not worry too much about covid putting you in the hospital, if you are still young and don't have diabetes or any other major health issues.    i am surprised that you have not tested positive for it yet though.  i caught covid back in early march.    my wife tried to avoid me.   but, she ended up getting it also shortly after.    my case was moderate.  but, i am 59 years old (in great shape though).  i never felt close to having to go to the hospital.  my wife is 40 and showed no symptoms at all.     we both tested positive for antibodies also a few months later.     i am going to be honest.    if i was in my 20's and my wife or gf had covid, i would probably avoid kissing her,  wear a mask around her and try and wash my hands after.   other than that, i would probably not worry too much about getting it   and, i would still see her and hug her when needed.   maybe this is just the codependent in me.   idk.   but, the risk of covid being severe when you are young is very, very minimal.   good luck.@ that is both sickening and scary :(@ my son is in the same boat.    he moved away to college last august to meet people and to get out of his introverted shell.      because of covid, all his classes are online and he is stuck paying room and board at the college for at least a year.  $15,000+ mistake (room and board) when he could be doing the same thing from home.  no break on tuition or room/board costs either because of the online classes.   ridiculous.@ i eat well and workout regularly.   i actually gained a few pounds on buproprion.   so, not everyone loses weight.     i have been on 150/xl for about 3 months.@ fwiw, for me the emotional affair is worse than sleeping with someone.     my wife actually stopped the very brief affair because she realized that he was just an online predator and had been doing the same thing to other women.    first, he starts liking all their online posts.   then, he sends them messages talking about his failed marriage and that he can never leave because he is jewish and that would bring shame to the family.   after that, he starts love-bombing them.    he is a real piece of work and my wife had also contacted a couple others he was doing this to.     my wife says that this could be a good thing in the end, because she learned to be careful with men and not let them too close into her life.   only time will tell if that turns out to be true or not.     the guy is lucky that he lives 1/2 way across the country.   i can promise you that he would regret it otherwise.   i have considered contacting his wife about things.  i know their name and address.   but, i have a feeling that she already knows her husband is a slime ball.   and, there may be something to divorce bringing shame to jewish families.   idk,@ this is such a sad story.    i wish you the best of luck op.@ this is the best advice that i have seen in this thread.    people often seek out rebound relationships with others they are comfortable with.    op, i think that he really wanted it to work out between you two, because he probably adores you as a friend and wanted it to be something more.    it just didn't work out for you guys as lovers.  there will be someone else for you down the road.   i have a feeling that at some point you and your friend/fwb may become friends again once you get over the hurt.   he cheated on you and that is bad.   but, his honesty accounts for something imo.   he could easily have kept  things from you and made up another excuse to break up.  a good friend of mine fell head over heels in love with a woman recently.    she broke up with him because she says \"she loves him too much\".    all that did was give him false hope and it took him 6 months to get over her, because he kept expecting her to come back.    the truth might hurt a bit at first.  but, it will save a lot of heartache in the long run.@ no offense taken at all.    yes.  it obviously bothers me.   i wish that my wife had been more honest about her affair (emotional affair).    but, we have been together 10 years and i know her better than anyone.   under normal conditions, we are usually close and share our thoughts on everything.  sometimes, you have to look at the big picture and consider all options.   there are no perfect relationships, because nobody is perfect.   marriage is  hard.  divorce is hard.   sometimes, you just have to choose between your hard.  nothing is guaranteed.    but, if i had to place a bet on whether or not it would happen again, i would bet against it.  i have made it quite clear that i would not tolerate the same thing happening again.    my wife is younger than me by quite a bit.   but, i am in great shape and still very attractive and people see us as a really good match.    so, from a physical standpoint i am not concerned about any mismatch.  and, i know that i am her best friend.  because she is younger, i want her to fully experience life.    if she had any sexual fantasies that she wanted to fulfill, i am would be ok with that together.   but, i am not ok with lies and deception.     we have discussed things like open relationships since then and neither of us wants that.  i hope this makes sense.    i made a decision and think that it was the right one.   but, time will tell.   the average marriage lasts about 7 to 8 years.   so, we are already beyond that.  i know that my story has kind of sidetracked you situation.  i am sorry for that.   i can tell you stories of deception and infidelity that are far worse than either of our situations.   i am not trying to minimize your feelings, because being hurt on any level is a horrible thing to deal with.    it may hurt right now.   but, it will pass, especially if you are young.  cheers.@ this affair happened about 2 1/2 years ago.   it only lasted a couple months online.  the first 7 years of our marriage everything was open regarding phones and social media.   then, she started locking every down to maintain her privacy (big red flag and i even complained about it).  we had been married 7 years and she was looking for more excitement in her life.     i was shocked at the time when i read the email.   her friends and family always that she was someone who would never cheat on me.  but, she got sucked into to a manipulative stalker online who completely played on her emotions.    my wife is stunningly beautiful and social.   so, she is going to always get hit on constantly, married or not.   i am not an insecure person.  so, i am not much bothered by that, as long as she doesn't lead anyone on.     i love here dearly but have always told myself i would not stand for cheating.  when i read her email to the guy, she mentioned that i was her best friend and she is never leaving me.   if she told him something like \"i don't love my husband anymore\", i would have left 100% for sure.   the guy was married also and had not intended to leave his family.     at the time, i told her that in order to stay in the relationship and get my trust back, i would need complete transparency from her.    this means no more locked phones or social media accounts.    at first, i did check her accounts for a while to gain some trust back.  and, even now i will look at them on a rare occasion if i think something is up.        but, the fact is my trust will never be where it once was.   she always says that she has learned her lesson and our marriage can be stronger because of it.    i of course, don't agree with that statement.    i cannot stand any form of lying, especially from someone closest to me.      best of luck to you.@ i understand that it hurts, especially losing a friend.    but, look at the bright side.   he had enough respect for you to tell you the truth.  he could have easily hidden things from you and used you while still seeing others.     my wife had a brief (2 month) online affair 3 years ago and she developed emotional feelings for the stalking scumbag.   it all ended when she actually met him (he flew in on business) and  and she realized he was just a player who falsely advertised himself.     she never told me.   i actually found out when i accidentally discovered one of their old conversations in her email.  i wasn't stalking at the time.   she had me look something up in her email and forgot to delete the old message.   for the longest time she denied ever meeting him and lied about several things.    because she kept lying about it and the fact that i had to find out on my own, i will never have the same 100% trust in her again.        had she done what your friend/bf did, things would be much better.    having drunk sex is one thing.   going on behind your husband/bf's back and lying about it is another.     once you get over the hurt, maybe you can still be friends again.    he made a mistake.   but, he was honest about it.@ this post is so spot on.     and now with covid, nearly every therapist is webcam only, for the same price.    it's not the same as talking to a real human in person  imho.        it's also hard to find a good therapist that you can relate to.   i have had 3 good ones in the past.   they all retired or moved their practice to another city within a year.     every time you see a new therapist,  everything starts over and you end up paying for 5 or 6 sessions, just to build any kind of rapport with them.     it's exhausting and expensive.     i am better off saving my money/time and just posting on reddit.@ cheating goes with snapchat, like frosting on a cake.@ no.   the anxiety is generalized.   i just don't feel like talking to people as much as i used to.@ yep.  i am in my 50's and my wife is in her late 30's.   her mom is in her 60's.     it's not like being 18 anymore and fantasizing about some of the neighborhood moms, because your sex drive is out of control.@ it certainly does change you perspective on things.   i see people as less attractive, which is strange.@ 3 months in and i am not as social as i once was.   it's not a major drop off.   but, i have noticed.   it may have something to do with the slightly more anxiety that i get from bupropion.@ my mil made a very aggressive pass at me one night after she was drinking.     she apologized the next day and i sat on it a couple days wondering whether or not i should tell my wife.     i ended up telling my wife, hoping that she would not bring it up with her mom.   i don't think she ever did.   when i told my wife initially, her response was only \"i am not surprised\".   that was not the reaction i expected.     it ended up not being an issue, thankfully.     this is such a delicate situation.   i wish you luck.   please follow up later.@ i cannot focus on my work without listening to music.   it literally is a lifesaver for me.@ i am in month three also and my results are nearly identical to yours.  sad is always a big deal for me, especially with the shrinking daylight.    i am having an off day today.  but generally, my depression has been held in check since starting bupropion.     thanks for the update.@ i am not really an advocate for open marriages, but they seem to work for some.   at this point, it sounds like its the only option if you want to stay married and living (mostly) with your wife.    you are basically in one already, except that you both are still hiding things from each other.@ be disciplined and don't overdue it.    make it a priority, not something to do in your spare time.    competitive body builders spend a lot of time at the gym.  however, everyone that is not a body builder can look fabulous by going only 3 days a week and spending 30-45 minutes each time on weights (assuming your diet is not awful).     when most people decide to start working out, they think they have to become gym rats.   they go 6  days a week and spend several hours at the gym.     then, they burn out and stop going completely because they overdue it and have no time for other activities.   i see it all the time, year after year, especially after new years for the month of january.  i have been going consistently 3 days a week for about 30 years straight.   i lift weights for no more than 45 minutes each time (i don't stop to chat or take breaks).    i get my cardio when i can by doing enjoyable activities like riding a bike, playing tennis, etc.     i also do about 15 minutes of pilates at home 4/5 days a week when i can.  it is mostly stretching and core work.    this becomes more important as you age imo.  i am 59 years old and my body looks almost identical to when i was 30, but with more definition.     my waist size had not changed in 25 years.    my weight always hangs around 210 lbs +/- 3 lbs.          again, make working out a priority.  but, don't overdue it.    schedule 3 days a week and stick to it.   almost everyone can find 30-45 minutes to sneak in a quick workout.@ \\^\\^\\^\\^ this \\^\\^\\^\\^  as a long time paxil user, it has helped with anxiety/panic.   but, i have had many bouts of mild depression or disinterest that were probably made worse on paxil.     i started on wellbutrin 2 months ago (in addition to paxil) and my depression is much, much better.@ always trust the person you love.    but, don't be stupid and ignore the first signs of trouble.   if your love suddenly goes emotionally distant, less affectionate or starts making accounts private, assume that there is an issue that needs to be addressed with good communication (or therapy).     this may save you the heartache later on of having him/her finding emotional or sexual support in someone else.   resolve the issues before they become larger than you can both handle.    growing apart is one thing.    being cheated on is another.  also, there is no such thing as a perfect marriage.    successful marriages always result from good communication and giving more than you expect back.@ this story is so heartbreaking :(    there is nothing worse that finding out the person you trust is carrying out something behind your back.   it goes beyond just sex.    it is completely disrespectful to the person that they are supposed to love.   i could get over a drunken 1 night stand.   but, a 6 month affair ?    i am so glad you didn't marry her and have kids.     like others have said, you are young with no kids.   however, i would suggest you talk to a therapist to help you through this.    the last thing you want to do is to walk around being bitter and never trusting a woman again, as tough as it might be right now.@ i just want to say that i am sorry you are going through this.    i used to get panic attacks many years ago before taking paxil.   but, they never lasted for more than 5 minutes.  i did have a bad situation regarding a prescription change and had one of those several hours long panic attacks one time.   i thought i was going to die.  nobody should have to live like that.     i started bupropion a few months ago (in addition to paxil) and it has helped a lot with depression and focus.    in the back of my mind though, i keep wondering if the panic attacks are going to start back up along with the mild anxiety that normally comes with buproprion.     best wishes and i hope you find something that works.   the world needs its surgeons.@ i think paxil is the worst when it comes to this.    fortunately, i have only been on 5mg for the last 10 years.  so, i have some feeling.  it is still difficult to orgasm.   i started at 20mg a long time ago and had almost no feeling with that dosage.@ there are so many lonely people in the world.   i feel for you all.   i would be lost without my wife.     i hope you all find someone to love.@ i don't think nude beaches are sexual places at all.    it is just a group of people comfortable with nudity.   this is what i hear from people that do go to them.   i don't go to them because i would feel uncomfortable and really don't want to see most people nude.  i think your gf has more of a chance to cheat in a private setting, than she does at a nude resort.    so, while going to a nude resort is somewhat unusual, i would be more concerned if she was spending a lot of time with one person and/or talking to them constantly.    if she is really into another guy, she will normally start becoming more distant to you.   those are the signs you need to look for imo.     if you can, try and stop worrying so much about it.   and, if you act controlling (i am not saying you are), it is just going to push her away.  you have to trust your partners in a relationship as you cannot protect them from everyone else in life.   if you are uncomfortable with your gf's  choices, she may not be right for you in the long run.@ i have been on a low dose of paxil for 20 years.    the last few years i have been suffering from mild depression and did not get much enjoyment out of life.    i started taking wellbutrin about 2 months ago and now feel inspired and enjoying life much more.@ it has been so long ago, that i can't fully remember the first few weeks.    i never really had daily anxiety,    so, i would not have noticed if it helped that.   i did have some social anxiety and anger issues and paxil helped with that.    but, the real reason that i stayed on paxil all these years was because it eliminated my panic attacks.     i could not initially stay on 20mg very long though, because i started feeling numb to life at that dosage and was having some sexual disfunction (it seems to do that to everyone).   so, i quickly dropped to 10mg after a couple months and then a few years later down to 5mg.    even at 5mg, i don't have panic attacks.   but, i still cannot get off paxil completely without terrible withdrawals.   i have tried gradually tapering off over a period of months, but could not do it.    so, i will be on paxil the rest of my life.     i would hate for you to take more than 20mg,.   even 20mg is pretty strong imo.   so, i hope it starts to help you soon.@ i think a lot  depends on how long you have been taking the ssri and the dosage.   if you have not been on an ssri long, you may be ok.   but, i would still taper the dosage.  i had been on paxil for 10 years (a while back).   my (former) dr switched me to lexapro cold turkey at the time.   i was very leery of doing it cold turkey, but he said they are both ssri's and that it would be ok.  boy was he wrong.    things started off fine for about 2 weeks.   then suddenly overnight, i had a completely breakdown.   it was a living hell after that for about 2 weeks until i switched back to paxil.    within 2 days of being back on paxil, my life had mostly returned to normal.     please be careful if switching ssri's cold turkey.   they are not the same, even if they are in the same famliy.@ i used to get regular panic attacks, claustrophobia and some social anxiety before paxil.   i have been on paxil for over 20 years.   i have tapered it down to only 5m and have been on that dosage for over 10 years.    still no panic attacks, claustrophobia or social anxiety.  so for me, the medicine is still working.     the only time i have had panic attacks over the last 20 years was when a foolish dr switched me from paxil to lexapro cold turkey 10 years ago \"because it has less side effects\".   it was a 4 week nightmare and i am back on paxil for the rest of my life.@ yes.   that is why i started taking it.    it hasn't really helped in that area.   but, i did notice that my depression has gone and i appreciate life more.    so, i plan on staying on wellbutrin unless something unexpected comes up.@ people take ssri's to get rid of the anxiety.   but, it dulls the senses and seems to make you care less about life.   ndri's like wellbutrin, seem to sharpen the senses and bring some anxiety back into your life.      imo, there is no perfect solution when it comes to anti-depressants and you have to target the things that are causing you the most unhappiness.  i have been on an ssri for many, many years (paxil).    i can't get off it now because of the withdrawals due to the length of time on the med.   over the last few years,  i started really suffering from mild depression and not caring about life much or other people.    i was not suicidal.  but, i did not really care if i was to die either and felt that my life was already complete and not really worth living anymore (robotic).   so, i recently starting taking wellbutrin.    now my depression is gone and i enjoy life more, but i also worry more about people important to me again and have more generalized anxiety.  major anxiety can be crippling for people and ssri's can really help.   but, life without some anxiety, is not really living imo.     you could add an ssri to your ndri and it will probably help  your anxiety.    but, please be careful.    the ssri will almost always cause some level of sexual dysfunction and will dull your senses to some level (depending on dosage).  if i were you, i would go see a therapist before adding an ssri to your ndri.   there may be a hidden psychological reason, or past trauma, that is causing you the relationship worries.    taking an additional anti-depressant will just be masking the real problem.  good luck.@ great post !@ i think what happened to your friend is the norm.    once you go off them (hopefully by tapering), things should return to normal.    it's not like people are going to have some sort of long-term spiritual awakening on anti-depressants imo.      however, the longer you take antidepressants, the less this may be true.  i have been on a very low dose of paxil for 20 years.   if i was to go off paxil now, i would probably be looking at a very long period of gradual tapering and terrible withdrawal (i have tried to get off twice in the past).   perhaps things would never return to normal.  i am not an medical expert.  but, i have done a lot of personal research.  most dr's have never tried antidepressants themselves.   so, i tend to trust the opinions of those who have actually taken them more when it comes to the actual results.@ \\^\\^\\^\\^\\^  this \\^\\^\\^\\^\\^   losing a spouse, family member or close friend to one of these cults (scientology, est and the others) is one of my biggest fears in life.     i feel terrible for you op and hope things work out.@ anti-depressants will definitely change the relationship dynamic in almost every case, because they change a persons brain chemistry and personality.     sometimes it is for the better, sometimes worse.    sometimes there is only a slight change.    but, things will almost always change.  i have been in multiple relationships where anti-depressants were involved (i take them also).    the relationship dynamic has always changed when anti-depressants were introduced.  my current wife of 10 years ago started taking topomax 3+ years ago because of binge drinking.   she says it has changed her life and giving her clarity.     but, it has also caused her to be less loving towards me and more abrasive towards everyone.   i much prefer my pre-topomax wife, but topomax may have saved her life in some ways and that i can appreciate.   i love my wife despite the changes and have no plans on leaving.    but, i miss her old personality.  with that said, as you get older you will find that relationships gradually change over time, with or without antidepressants.       but with antidepressants, the change is more immediate.@ without proof, i feel that you need to give her the benefit of the doubt.    she does deserve some credit for even bringing up the subject of ffm and swinging at all.   she could easily just have kept quiet and completely cheated behind your back to avoid any kind of conflict.  she obviously loves you still and does not want to lose you.  with that said, i would be suspicious for a good while.    i feel like you need to find out whether she just has these sexual fantasies that she wants to act on, or she has developed emotional feelings for this guy.    i would be more concerned about the latter.  i had been in a very similar situation in the past and needed to prove to myself that she had cutoff all communications with this particular guy (online stalker that got her attention~..sexting/etc).   some things that i did for a while to make sure he was out of the picture.  1. looking around for a possible burner phone.   my wife would never go to this length and yours probably would not either.  so, i never really looked. 2. check her phone/tablets for apps like snapchat or kik, which are commonly used by cheaters.    i ended up finding the guy online and saw that he was a really player, using lots of social media burner accounts and apps like kik that deletes messages.    my wife did not have any of these apps.    they just communicated through phone pm's and facebook pm. 3. you can check your phone records online for suspicious numbers that she had called or texted with in the past.   i would bet that for a short while at least, there will be a lot of interaction with 1 particular phone record.  this is how i found the guy after my wife confessed about the online affair.     note this number and see if it is still getting called or texted.    of course, i am assuming the pm was not sent from one of the social media sites in your case.  good luck.  i hope things work out for you.    you said that you guys do a lot of kinky things.  it is possible she wants really to take this to another level.   if so, you guys are going to really need to communicate on that subject and try and find some  common ground.  fwiw, after my wife had the online affair, she admitted that she was looking for more excitement in her life.    so, we agreed to go to a swingers club just to see if that is something that would satisfy her need at the time.    we went once and had fun (did nothing sexual).   afterwards, she realized she really didn't want to play around outside the marriage and it was just a fantasy for a while.   that was 3 years ago.    in some ways, i am glad that the online affair happened.   it seemed to have strengthened our marriage in a lot of ways.     there are days though when i want to fly out of state an punch that assholes face in.  i know where he lives and he has a wife and kids.  hopefully, your wife doesn't have any emotional attachment with this guy and vice versa.   if so, that needs to be dealt with immediately.@ i am a man and have never cheated on either of my 2 wives or any girlfriend prior to that.  i have been cheated on by women twice in my life.   but, i hold no grudges.  there are cheaters on both sides.@ i started taking wellbutrin 6 weeks ago in an attempt to counter mild sexual disfunction from my ssri (paxil for almost 20 years).    it didn't help with the sexual disfunction.  however, i have found that my mild depression has greatly improved with bupropion, which did increase motivation.    the only negative i have had is increased anxiety.  this is a great site for learning about the different types of antidepressants and what they target.       if you get on an ssri, like prozac, it should help with any level of anxiety (general, social, panic attacks, claustrophobia).   that is why i have been on a low dose of paxil (for many years).    but, they can also numb your senses and turn you into a zombie, especially on higher doses.     they also cause some level of sexual disfunction in most people.       there is no perfect antidepressant.    every one of them seems to help out in one area and cause more problems in another area.   being on paxil really helped with my social anxiety (minor) and panic attacks (major).   but, it has dulled my senses and caused some depression (and sexual dysfunction).    the wellbutrin has helped with the depression, but put some anxiety back in my life.     so, there are always tradeoffs with these drugs.       you are still very young.   good luck and be careful.@ the first day for me  was by far the most bizarre and i am on week 6.   i would not worry about it at all.@ fwiw, i had issues with drinking and bupropion the first 2 weeks of being on it.   now, everything is back to normal regarding alcohol.  i am a fairly heavy drinker (2 to 4 beers a day on avg).   i did have to back off a lot those first 2 weeks though.@ this is terrific advice.    money matters are the number #1 point of conflict in relationships.@ yep.   a lot of ed is psychological.     when i was in my teens and 20's, my sex drive was off the charts high.   but, until i had a long term girlfriend in my mid-20's, my anxiety would cause a lot of ed during short term dating, one night stands, etc.  we all know antidepressants do also contribute to ed.    because of that, i would recommend that op try something like cialis or viagra.   i prefer cialis myself.   they may  help with the erection, which in turn may also help op's confidence and anxiety.@ you did mention boundaries.  sorry about that.   laziness on my part.   that does change my perspective on things a bit.     i still agree with others who say it was inappropriate, but not cheating.   to me, cheating is always done behind someone's back or in private.        i don't necessarily think this is a deal breaker between you two right now.   but, you do need to put your foot down on crossing boundaries.   his limits may be more than you are willing to deal with, without sacrificing your own morals or feelings.@ almost exactly the same as me.   6 weeks on 150xl.    only casual/social smoker.   i probably go through 3 or 4 packs a year, but also smoke when offered in social gatherings when i have none of my own.     no difference in taste at all for me either.     i have also been craving cigs more lately, as my anxiety tends to run higher on wellbutrin.     i am going to refrain from buying any in the near future, because the last pack went too fast and i started smoking any time my anxiety was high (not just socially).@ definitely not cheating.   but, you guys should have discussed boundaries before you went.  my wife and i went to a swingers club once to see what it was about.    although we had fun, it was not really our thing.  we made sure to discuss boundaries before we went and stuck to them.@ so, so true.     i got terrible advice from a doctor 10 years ago who switched me from paxil to lexapro cold turkey.    everything was fine for a few weeks until i had a breakdown in the middle of the night (horrible panic attack).    it was the only time in my life when i would have considered suicide just to make it stop.    fortunately, i did not own a gun at that time.     op sounds like he has been down this road before though.@ i told myself that i would wait 6 weeks before making a decision.    i had very little anxiety the first 2 weeks.   then, the anxiety shot through the roof during weeks 3 and 4.  i am now in week 5 and the anxiety levels have dropped again.    caffeine is not the culprit and i have no outside stresses.   it is just the wellbutrin that seems to be running its course.    i hope the anxiety stays away, because there are many positives that i am getting from this drug.@ i hear these stories about weight loss on buproprion.    i am having to diet to keep from gaining weight.    i would love to be able to pack on more calories right now :(@ this is my 5th week on 150 xl.    the first 2 weeks i had little or no anxiety.   then, my anxiety shot up in weeks 3 and 4 to the point where i almost quit.   for some reason though, my anxiety has dropped back down again in week 5.     when my anxiety got high in week 4, i quit drinking my daily cup of coffee to see if it was the caffeine.    it was not the caffeine/coffee.  for the last 5 days now i have had very little anxiety.   so, maybe it is tapering off.@ here are some withdrawal side effects that people have reported during withdrawal:  insomnia, irritability, dizziness, headache, flu-likesymptoms, vertigo, nausea, confusion, anxiety, excessive dreaming and suicidal thoughts.   my withdrawal symptoms when i was trying to taper off the drug were mainly mania, anxiety and irritability.   my wife said i was impossible to deal with.   this went on for about 3 weeks after tapering off the drug.  the worst was one time when i went off paxil cold turkey.   after 10 years of paxil use, i had a dr switch me from paxil to lexapro, with no tapering off the paxil.   things were fine for about 3 to 4 weeks, then all hell broke loose.    i had a horrible panic attack that lasted over an hour.   for the next week or so  i could not eat, the world looked like a strange place, i had the worst anxiety of my life.    the second i woke up in the morning, i would go into immediate panic and just bury my head in the pillow.    life was a living hell unless i was drinking alcohol or loading up on xanax (not good).  against my dr's orders, i switched back to paxil and within 24 hours started feeling better.   i was back to normal by the 3rd day.     paxil can work for many people.   but, it seems like there will always be tradeoffs.   with paxil, the biggest negative for most people is probably the decreased libido and sexual sensitivity (difficult orgasm).  i am not sure why you were prescribed paxil (depression, anxiety, panic attacks).   but, i would break the 20mg tablets in half and take only 10mg for your trial period.   20mg of paxil is a pretty heavy dose imo, even though the drug company usually recommends that as a starting dosage.     if you don't need that much, why take it ?    it is much better to start out smaller and ramp up if needed imo.     good luck.@ i really, really, really dislike this woman@ first, most of those extreme side effects should go away eventually, except for the sexual side effects which will stay unfortunately :(  i have been down this exact road after being on paxil for about 20 years now and i have strong opinions on this exact subject.  20 years ago my dr gave me 20mg paxil for anxiety after the birth of our first child.     i did feel less anxiety.   but, paxil also really helped with my panic attacks and claustrophobia that i would also get.     i never told my dr about those symptoms and was pleasantly surprised that they disappeared with paxil.  of course, paxil gave me the negative sexual side effects and also at 20mg i became emotionally numb to things that normally gave me joy in life.   so, i started to reduce my dosage to see if it would help with some of these negative side effects, yet still help with eliminating the panic attacks.  so, after being on 20mg paxil for a month,  i lowered the paxil dose to 10mg.    at that dosage i still had no panic attacks and \"dullness\" was not as bad.    after a few more years, i decided to drop to 5mg paxil (gradually).    even at 5mg, no more panic attacks.    i have been  on 5mg now for a long, long time.   i have tried to get off it completely a few times.   but, it is not going to happen for me as the withdrawals are horrible (even after gradual tapering).  if i were you, i would not increase to 20mg.    i would stay at 10mg and maybe even reduce to 5mg later on if it still works for you at that dosage.    even at 5mg, i still have negative sexual side effects.   but, they are not as bad.   also at 5mg, paxil does does not turn me into a zombie when it comes to enjoying life.  i don't know why medical professionals don't start at something like 5mg and then ramp up the dosage if needed.    paxil obviously can have some unpleasant side effects (especially sexual).   and, the higher the dose, the withdrawals are worse if you ever want to quit.  i would certainly stay at 10mg right now and see if that still works for you.  please keep in mind to never go off an ssri, especially paxil, cold turkey.   you need to gradually reduce your dosage over a week or two to get where you want to be.     and, the longer you are on paxil, the longer you have to be careful about withdrawals.   after 10 years and 15 years, i tried to get off it completely by gradually reducing the paxil dosage over several months.    it still wasn't enough and the withdrawals were terrible.   so, i will be on paxil until my last hours on earth.  i hope this helps.   good luck to you.    i hate the fact that i have been on paxil for so long.    it has been wonderful in helping me with panic attacks, claustrophobia and social anxiety.   but, there is of course a cost as it can turn you into a zombie at high dosages and of course there is the sexual side effects that nearly everyone will get.@ i am so, so sorry.   emotional cheating and lying about it is worse than sleeping with someone imo.     if my partner had sex with someone and confessed to me about it, at least i could trust them because they were honest.      sneaking around behind your back and carrying on an emotional affair is just gut-wrenching when it is eventually discovered.  i hate liars more than anything.   get ready for him to deny it all and make up some lame excuse to try and hang on to you.  i wish you all the luck in the world in dealing with this.   nobody deserves this kind of pain and suffering.@ for me after 1+ month:  good:  more focus, less depression, less agitation/anger   bad: less sex drive i think due to less aggression.   slightly more anxiety i think.  no change:  energy levels same, but i am fairly active with healthy diet.@ you said that you switched from prozac to bupropion.    how long were you on prozac ?   did you stop completely when you switched to bupropion ?  if you have been on the prozac for some time and made the switch to bupropion without tapering the prozac, my guess is you are suffering from prozac withdrawal.    bupropion is a different class of drugs from ssri's.    prozac affects serotonin.      bupropion affects norepinephine and dopamine levels.     if you quit prozac abruptly, you may be having issues with serotonin levels imo.  after 10 years of being on paxil, i had a dr switch me to lexapro without tapering.   it was a completely nightmare.    so, i had to switch back to paxil.    you can't even switch between ssri's, because they are all slightly different.    i found this out the hard way.@ not all anti-depressants dull you down.    yes, all ssri's do.  but, there are other types of antidepressants.     i have been on a child's does of paxil for 20 years.    it did dull me down and cause other issues.   but, i never suffered from depression until the last few years.     over the last few years, i got enjoyment from almost nothing.   no amount of therapy helped.    i have worked out on a regular basis my entire life.     a month ago my dr started me on wellbutrin in addition to  the paxil (i can't get off paxil at this of my life).    the wellbutrin has definitely helped.    i have hobbies again.   my work has improved.     i look forward to doing things on weekends, instead of just wanting to sleep.     it's hit or miss with anti-depressants.   you have to find one that works for you.    i agree that they should be a last resort.   but, if you have tried everything else, they are worth a try imo.@ going on 4 weeks now of 150 xl.   i was hoping wellbutrin would counteract my ssri when it comes to difficult orgasm.    it hasn't worked for me.   in fact, my sex drive seems worse.  however, wellbutrin is one of the few options that does seem to help some people's ssri reduced sex drive, even if not me.  so, maybe it is worth a shot.  i will say that i had been suffering from mild depression.  and wellbutrin seems to have helped that.   so, i may stay on it for a while yet.@ i would stay away from paxil, unless it is a last resort.    it has some of the worst side effects.   and, it is terribly difficult to get off.     i have been on it for 20 years.    i have tried 2 times to get off, spread out over several months.   the withdrawal was awful and i now realize that i will be on it forever.      the one good thing that paxil did was get rid of my panic attacks.   it is well known for that.   i would try something else first for depression though, because you have options.   some say that lexapro has less side effects.@ beautiful work and incredibly passionate.@ yep.  at this point they will have to be absolutely transparent with each other (messages and online accounts), if he really wants to work it out.    if op's boyfriend isn't willing to do that, it's not going to stop.@ i have done the same.      about 10 years ago a friend at work was telling me about her friend on ashley madison.    so, i created  an account just so that she and i could see how it worked.    however, i never paid for any of the credits and deleted the app shortly after.  i never had any intentions of use the app, we were just curious.  op.  sorry about this.   if he is not being transparent about his activities (i.e. letting you see his purchase history), then he is surely lying.     i have been through a similar thing with an ex.   she started locking down all her accounts and eventually i caught her having an online affair.    after i threated to leave, she decided to be completely transparent about her activities (giving me all her passcodes).    that was the only way i was going to trust her again.    after a while i regained that trust, but only because she stopped hiding things.  i ended leaving her.  but, it was for reasons other than the online affair.@ you sir~~..are amazing and so is your invention.@ yep.  i gained 8 points the first 10 days on 150xl.    it is not normal for my weight to fluctuate.  as a result,  i have been dieting heavily since then and have lost the weight gained.   totally did not expect that.     i seem to be am hungry all the time now.      today is 3 weeks since starting wellbutrin.    i guess everyone is different.   a lot of my  side effects on this med have been the opposite of the normal reported behaviours.@ i was just talking about ghosting tonight with one of my single guy friends.    he is a great looking guy and gets lots of interest on bumble and a couple others.   the conversations often go great and then they set up a date.     on the day of the date, he confirms with them beforehand and is usually ghosted.    he says this happens over half the time.  this would drive me absolutely crazy if i was a single man in today's world.    are people so shallow and uncaring these days that they would make a date, only to ghost them if something better comes along ?     my time is really valuable to me, which is probably why i honor my commitments to others.   i would never ghost anyone and find it completely disrespectful.    i would at least expect a phone call or text if they can't make it.     i get angry just thinking about it.@ same here.    my age cutoff for dating has always been 12 years difference, because i felt there was no way that i could connect with someone younger than that.   in my work, i have known plenty of women that are a generation younger than me and have never felt a compatibility with any of them, other than physical attraction.     10 years ago i met my current wife, who is 19 years younger.   she was and is beautiful.   but, she knocked my socks off in every other way.   we liked the same music, art and basically had all the same interests.      she initially had to ask me out, because there was no way that i thought there would be mutual interest.    10 years later i still look at her in awe and we are best friends.   i would have never thought it possible.@ as others have said, just be honest with him.     my wife is 19 years younger and we are both currently monogamous.   however, if she wanted to experiment sexually with something new, i would certainly consider it as long as it is not done behind my back.     i have told her before that i would seriously consider having her explore any sexual fantasies that she may have.   but, cheating is not an option.@ she probably has no real money anyway.     a drunk,  angry women (ex friend)  threw an ashtray at my wife and chipped several of her upper teeth.    it cost us many thousands $$$ to fix.    my wife filed a lawsuit against her for damages.   we won of course and she was forced to pay the entire amount to repair my wife's teeth.     unfortunately we never saw a cent from her.   we both laughed when winning the suit, because we knew she wouldn't pay even though she always bragged about her successful career in nyc.   she disappeared shortly after.@ yep.   i have been on 150  xl for 3 weeks.   my appetite is just as strong as ever, unfortunately :)@ yea, it's all crazy.    i honestly put more stock in what message board users say, than most dr's when it comes to ssri's.    imo, most dr's don't do enough research and only listen to the big pharma company sales pitches.     i guess that is why we are all here.   i actually want to hear feedback from people that have actually taken the drug.@ i have only been cheated on once in my life (that i know anyway).   i always wished that i was someone that could be cool and keep it secret until i had gathered a lot of evidence.  but, i wear my emotions on my sleeve.   when i accidentally found out i had been cheated on once, i had to confront her about it immediately.    i could never be a cheater myself, because anybody that knew me would see the guilt all over my face.@ i agree.    they have usually been cheated on or they are cheating on their s.o.     i have seen it personally.@ same here.   i love the taste of craft beer.   but, i don't really need the alcohol anymore on bupropion.  unfortunately, the beer that i really enjoy (taste) are high alcohol ipa's.  now after drinking that first beer, i ask myself why did i do it ?     in the past, alcohol was a stress reliever.   now, it just seems to make me a bit grumpy in small amounts.  i really don't think you have much to worry about.    as the other guy said, start slow.@ i have seen articles saying that a large portion of the seizures are actually from moderate/heavy drinkers who quit abruptly while taking bupropion.    for moderate/heavy drinkers, they say not to stop unless you are tapering off.  i doubt that one beer a day is going to really affect you.  i love craft beer and drink it moderately (avg 18-24 beers a week probably).    i do notice that the effects of alcohol on bupropion are stronger as are the hangovers.     i now always get a minor headache after the first drink that goes away with more.     but,the next day after moderate drinking i am usually dizzy and very tired.    prior to bupropion the same amount of beer would previously not have given me a hangover.@ after seeing unhinged a week ago, i am going to try really hard to avoid any road rage conflicts.@ it amazes me how people react differently.    i seem to have more focus and patience than before.  also less depression.     i also have much less sex drive.   this is after 2 1/2 weeks.     i am going to give it 4 to 6 weeks before deciding to continue.    the negatives may end up outweighing the positives if things dont change.    at least i don't have anxiety like others do.@ what's crazy is that if you were a moderate/heavy drinker before taking buproprion, you risk having seizures if you stop drinking abruptly while taking the drug.   so, many experts seem to say to not stop drinking completely when starting buproprion.     on the other hand, buproprion is known to enhance the effects of alcohol, which is what i am running into.    so, that is bad also.     maybe the lessen is that if you are a moderate/heavy drinker, buproprion is probably not for you.@ yep.  same here.    i started taking bupropion to try and counter my 5mg paxil sexual side effects (difficult orgasm).     after 2+ weeks, i cannot get a full erection now either.  i also love my craft beer.    with bupropion, i get headaches from even 1 beer.  and, i am dizzy the next day from the alcohol.   really strange.   my alcohol tolerance is usually very high and i almost never get hangovers from beer drinking.  i will wait another week or two and then decide if i stay on bupropion.   there are some positives.@ ditto for me.    libido is down.   my testosterone is fine.     not feeling any depression.@ 2 weeks ago i started taking 150 xl (wellbutrin) to counteract the paxil sexual side effects.   it hasn't done anything for my libido unfortunately.     but, i am on the other side of 50.@ yeah, when i read something that sounds fishy, i just check their history.   if it is a new account, it is not worth my time responding to their questions.@ i doubt this is the case.    but, did you by any chance stop taking another med when you started wellbutrin ?     i had a doctor switch my ssri's without tapering and had similar experiences (but much worse).@ started 150 xl a week ago.   i normally drink 1 cup of coffee first thing in the morning.     on the first day of 150 xl, the coffee seemed to be amplified by 3x.   however, on that first day my body was reacting strangely to a lot of things.           1 week later and i am back to normal regarding the coffee.   no issues at all.@ don't waste your time replying.   it's fake.  check his profile.@ i am so sorry all of this has happened to you.  but, you seem to be handling it very well.   keep your head up.   you know what you need to do.@ you are spot on with this.   excellent observation.@ wow.   i started on this drug 1 week ago (150 xl).    and i have had the same exact issues with time.    i thought it was just me.    my ability to focus on tasks has improved though.  so, i think they are related.@ when the us invaded kuwait/iraq in the 90's, i thought we were headed for ww 3 and became very sentimental.      i continued dating a woman that i had extreme doubts about (she was later diagnosed with bpd).   i continued dating her only because i didn't want to be alone at the time.     we got serious after a few months and she wanted to marry.    even with my doubts, i agreed.    our marriage was not right and we were a bad match and i knew it inside.   unfortunately, she ended up getting pregnant with child early in the marriage.    i realized early that she had a major personality disorder.  i stayed 16 years for my children, because i didn't want them to be alone with her (she was abusive).      so yes, i totally agree that the pandemic now is causing people to want to settle down with someone, even if it is not right.    this happened to me before many years ago.  on the other hand, with so many couples working from home and being together 24/7, it is also causing a lot of divorces.     my current wife of 10 years and suddenly having moderate issues, because we just can't seem to get away from each other for any alone time.   we are both working from home now.    because of covid, our friends don't even want to hang out.     everyone needs a break from their spouse on occasion.    this pandemic is ruining many existing relationships and causing single people to want a relationship out of loneliness.   things are such a mess.@ incredible.    i would love to see him create a robotic pterodactyl.@ i had a (bad) dr who changed me from paxil to lexapro with no tapering of the paxil.    things were fine for 3 weeks and then i had a panic attack from hell in the middle of the night.    for the next week i could not eat and could barely drink.   my home looked like an alien planet.   all i could do was bury my head in a pillow at times because of the anxiety/terror.    it was a 24 hour nightmare.  i asked the dr if it could be paxil withdrawal and he said no.    after about another week i ignored his advice and went back to paxil.     i was eating within 24 hours and felt 100% myself in 3 days.  please don't let a dr just switch ssri's on you without tapering off the old one.@ my paxil usage.    * first 3 months - 20mg * next 1 year - 10 mg * next 18 years - 5mg  i had no problem going from 20 to 10mg or even 10mg to 5mg.    but, since i have been on 5mg for 18 years, i just can't get off of it.    i have tried several times.     each time i make it about 3 to 5 weeks before having some kind of major breakdown (almost stroke like).  i think a lot of the ability to get off of it, depends on how long you have been on it.   after 18 years, it would probably take me over a year to reduce the dosage enough to the point where i have no withdrawals.    this is true even though i am only on 5mg.   my body has just adjusted to it over too long of time imo.@ i have never cheated on anyone in all my years.   i came close in my prior marriage, but our marriage was definitely not good.  a narcissist is someone that would cheat like that. it is estimate that 6% of the population actually suffers from true narcissistic personality disorder.  and, there are many more people just outside of being a true npd, but who still show tendencies.     search the net for narcissim and cheating and you will see what i am talking about.@ my depression has really increased with covid.   i am lucky that my job is still ok.  but, i really dislike having to work from home every day, when i have a terrific office 10 minutes away.   my wife and i are not used to being around each other 24/7 and it is wearing on us.    we used to hang out with others couples and now everyone is too scared to do anything (we have both already had covid).     i guess my point is that covid is causing a lot of depression.   i have been on low dose paxil for 20 years.   i have never been this depressed before.@ yeah.   i am going to stick it out at least 6 weeks before i make any real judgements.   i am not too worried about the weight gain.   i can get that down.     i am most worried about libido issues.    my sex drive is actually down, when this drug usually goes the other way for people.@ i have been on 150 xl a week and actually gained weight :(     i don't feel like i have eaten that much.   but, i seem to have less anxiety and i don't have the energy boost that others have mentioned.   so, maybe they are related (anxiety & energy -> weight loss ?).@ so many people seem to lose weight on this med.   i have been on it a week and gained 5 pounds and wife said i was getting a belly.   my diet hasn't changed.    prior to starting wellbutrin a week ago, my weight has remained consistent for years.  hopefully this is just an anomaly.    when i started paxil 20 years ago, i put on an immediate 20 pounds and then leveled off.     back then i wanted the extra weight, not now.@ was it inappropriate ?   yes.    seeing her ex is also disrespectful to you, since you asked her not to.    however, i have a hard time putting this in the same category as cheating, if she just met up with him one time to talk.    she told you nothing happened.  you should trust her on that, unless she has a prior history of lying/cheating.  on the positive side, she did eventually tell you.   that is better than finding out on your own.  a lot of people stay in contact with their ex's without having an affair.     there is a good reason she is with you and not with those people any more.   at this point, her actions would not be a relationship breaker for me.    however, it is something to keep an eye on.@ yes.   i just started recently and feel spaced out at times (in a fog).    i questioned my ability to drive also the first day.    but, i am working from home during covid.  so, i haven't had a need to drive.  i did ride with my wife yesterday and it felt like she driving insane.     she always drives that way.  but yesterday, it really gave me anxiety and i was freaking out a bit.    i probably need to go out for lunch today to test out the driving experience myself.@ i started on wednesday of this week.    my sleep patterns are slightly off at this point and i have also had very mild hallucinations at times (plus very mild headache and jaw clinching).    however,  i did expect all this because i have been through the initial stages with other drugs before.   things tend to mellow out after a few weeks and i expect the same with this drug.     my ability to focus on things is definitely better, even at this point.@ yeah.   i have slight headache and tight jaw also (only day 3 for me though).    i remember starting paxil 20 years ago though and had similar strange effects that eventually wore off.@ thanks for sharing.   i am on day 3 of  wellbutrin (also 20 years of very small paxil dose).    i have seem similar results.    i am definitely less sleepy.   i haven't really seen a phsical energy boost though.    i am focusing on work much better, more patient.    i know it is still early and things are going to change (probably smooth out a bit).    but, so far so good.    i haven't seen a libido increase yet (that is one thing i am hoping for).@ i am on day 3.   i have also had headaches since day 1.  but, they have been very slight.@ your post is spot on.@ you forgot the near category 5 hurricane that is about to hit the gulf coast~.lol     i think people are pretty much numb to any bad news these days.@ op, please listen to what he just said.    i take klonopin no more than twice a week to help me sleep better.   klonopin has a half life of about 30 to 40 hours.    you need to space it out to allow klonopin to leave your system and avoid stacking of the drug.  i look forward to the days when i can take klonopin.   but, i have not built up any tolerance or addiction to it after 9 years.   sometimes i will go over a week without taking it and never even realize that i have been off it so long.  this is not a drug that you should use daily.    if you do, you are asking for big trouble down the road.   but, it can be a wonderful drug for short term or occasional use imo.@ good luck to you.   i started 150mg of xl this morning (still on low dose paxil).    right now i don't  feel too much anxiety.   but, i am completely hyped up and spaced out at the same time.    really strange.   it's so weird how every anti-depressive drug makes everyone feel different.@ i will be following this thread as i just started buproprion this morning (150mg xl once per day in morning).    i am also on it to try and restore my libido and fatigue issues after 20 years of being on a low-dosage of paxil.    i have no plans to cut out paxil and suffer that withdrawal as i tried it once before.      2 hours after taking my first pill this morning and i am spaced out as hell.   not sure that i would want to get behind the wheel of a car right now.    i am not really concerned though.   i know all these mental drugs can really mess with your head in the beginning.@ this happened to me with weed gummy's about a month ago.   they were supposed to be mild and sedative.    i ended up having a horribly bad trip that lasted about 4 hours.   i was lucky that my wife was around (she didn't take one).   she was able to keep me calm and remind me that i taken gummy's, because i didn't know if i was asleep and having a nightmare or having a stroke.     i probably won't touch weed again now.    it was the worst trip ever and i have taken quite a few hallucinogens many years ago in my 20's.@ it will be interesting to see if the two cheaters hook up together.   it would be poetic justice because eventually one or both of them will cheat again.@ i wish that i could enjoy weed more.    but, thc in any form gives me terrible cottonmouth.  it gets so bad that i cannot even feel or taste liquids.@ exactly.   being cheated on is far worse than finding out your significant other is having sexual fantasies about others.@ cheating will probably end your relationship.     an open relationship will most likely be too much for him to take.  if it were me, i would hint around to my spouse about maybe going to a swingers club or finding other couples to play with.   the difference is that you are doing it together.   and, because the other couple is also committed,  you have less chance of your spouse developing an emotional relationship.  sex is sex.    i would probably not be upset if my wife wanted to explore her sexual side with someone else.   but,   my concern with an open marriage would be the emotional bond that may come with it.@ after being on a low dose of paxil for over 20 years, i am considering asking my dr about adding wellbutrin (i have difficulty with orgasm and only minor interest in sex).           i wish that wellbutrin had a shorter half-life and could be used on demand when needed (like cialis/viagra).    i am not sure my wife could handle me having a super high sex drive again all the time.@ nope.   i have no fears about covid.  but, this is partially due to the fact that i already had it back in march.   both my wife and i have tested positive for antibodies.   in theory we could get it again if our antibodies have gone away.  but, we certainly don't worry about it.   we still wear masks fwiw, but not for our benefit.     i am too busy having repetitive dreams with no clothes on, missing articles of clothing, dealing with violent people,  airplane crashes and missing college courses resulting in a failing grade (i graduated in the late 80's).     what happened to the enjoyable dreams, like sex ?@ i agree.  after 12pm seems to be better for parking than the morning passes.  although, you have to deal with afternoon storms.  plus, it's so much prettier in the mornings with the clear, crisp skies.@ exactly.   divorce rates are spiking as people are having to spend more time with their spouses and realizing they really can't cope being around each other much.  my wife and i are both having to work from home since march.   i used to work at an office which allowed us some space.    we have had to make some adjustments in our relationship to give each others time alone.   both of us get more aggravated with each other at times.        with that said, i am much happier having my wife around 24/7 than i would being lonely and single right now.    i can't imagine how hard it must be.  i totally miss hanging out with other couples/friends.    we did this a lot before covid and haven't hung around with anyone since then.    very depressing as we are both social people.@ i am on my second marriage (10 years).   near the end of first marriage (17 years), i had an emotional affair with my co-worker.    at the time, i thought i was doing nothing wrong.   but, i would get her coffee, bring her lunch and always be present for her to talk (she always complained about her life).  my male friends told me to be careful and that i was getting emotionally attached.   she had a husband that i respected.    i was not trying to sleep with her or take her away from her husband.   but, i enjoyed spending time with her too much.   at the time, my thinking was as long as i did nothing physical, there was nothing wrong with having a close relationship.  she was filling a void that i was missing in my marriage.   not sex, but conversation that led to an attraction.   and, i used to be one of those guys that would always be there for a pretty woman complaining about her life.  back then, i associated affairs with sex only.   i have long since realized that emotional affairs are probably more damaging then physical ones.     i have never physically cheated on anyone that i was dating.    and, i only had this emotional affair once and learned my lesson.  after the emotional affair, i realized that i could not stay in my first marriage and left (with kids).   if you have to look elsewhere for any kind of attention, sexually or emotionally, something is really lacking in the marriage.  i hope this helps from an ignorant mans perspective.   i am ashamed of my behavior back then.    but, i learned a bit lesson.  maybe your husband has learned a lesson.   but, he should not have had to look elsewhere for attention if things were great at home.    so at this point, he is either missing something at home or just a cheating narcissist.    he sounds like the former imo.  good luck.@ the lots fill up in the morning.   by afternoon, most of the hard core hikers have returned from their trips and the lots are less crowded.  the only issue with afternoon hikes are the thunderstorms.   you don't want to get caught out in the open when the storms are triggered at the higher elevation hikes imo.@ the ute ridge trail (in the park), above the treeline, is awesome.   it is a 4m round trip and is not crowded.    however, parking can be a bit of a problem because of the small lot on fall river road.    get their early, before the afternoon storms fire up.     just a gorgeous hike and it is the perfect distance for you.@ what i found interesting was all the cars lined up on the side of the road just outside the park, waiting for their time slot to come up so that they could enter asap.@ beautiful video.   the camera does make things look pretty terrifying, compared to reality.    what an achievement though.   something for me to look forward to, in the next life ;)@ this comment is so on point.    the problem is that it takes strong willpower to avoid the confrontation.   i wear my emotions on my sleeve and would struggle with acting as nothing out of the ordinary was going on.    i applaud those that can actually pull this off.@ wow.   that's messed up.   i feel for you.     i am sorry about your baby.   but, maybe it was not meant to be.   i am a guy that stayed in an unhappy marriage for 17 years because of a surprise pregnancy.     i love my kids and have no regrets about having them.    but, they grew up in a household that did not give them a good education on what a happy family is.   they grew up in a household where the parents were there to love and serve them, not each other.     both my kids (20 and 22) struggle with relationships today.     plus, having a baby with this guy would have tied you to him for at least the next 18 years.    keep you head up.    maybe this is all for the best.@ the erectile dysfunction the first night was probably due to the 1 zoloft pill you took.   since then, you may still have some drug residue, but most likely you are just worrying too much.   you probably panicked that first night because of the zoloft.   now, you are just thinking about it too much imo.  i believe the half life for zoloft ranges from 24-36 hours.   that is how long it takes for 50% of the drug to leave your system.  so, you would roughly have 50mg in your system after 1-2 days, 25mg after 2-3 days, 12.5mg after 4-5 days, etc.@ other culprits of reduced sex drive are age, blood pressure, diet, exercise and of course depression/anxiety.  covid has changed peoples lives and not in a good way (loss of jobs, social restrictions).    there is a lot of anxiety and depression going on right now.    i would not worry about attaching a label (pssd) to things at this time.     my wife and i rarely have sex right now, because we are forced to be around each other 24/7 and we are both suffering from more depression and anxiety than usual.@ personally, i think you are just worrying about it too much.   it doesn't take much to shake a mans confidence in that area.          i don't know enough about pssd personally to make a judgement on your situation.    but, i have known plenty of men that have caused some form of sexual disfunction by worrying about things too much.     i don't have pssd by the way.   my problems are related to be being on paxil for 20 years.   if i quit paxil for about 5 days, my sex drive generally comes back, but so does my anxiety and withdrawal symptoms start creeping up.@ when you get aroused, your brain sends signals to trigger a hormonal response that allows the penile arteries to open completely.   ssri's can prevent you from getting aroused, because it numbs your emotions.    that is why you may not get the normal blood flow.    of course, there are other health reasons that can cause that.  but, if the problem just started with your ssri, i doubt that the problem is health related.  the other thing that my happen to you is that you will find it harder to orgasm.  another lovely little bonus from taking an ssri :(     if you want more blood flow and erections, you can always add a prescription for cialis or viagra (i prefer cialis)@ yep.  we got burned by this all 4 days we were there with early passes.    we were disappointed, but you can't really blame those that got there before 6am.   it's not like they were breaking any rules.   we just did not expect that when we bought our early morning passes day 1 when they went on sale.@ i was thrilled when i bought my 6am timed entry passes (for late july) on the first day they went on sale back in june.    i expected much less crowds (reducing the timed reservations by about 60% of normal).     then, we went to the park and found out that 6am was too late and the lots were jammed.   we still had a great time.   but, the worry about finding parking spots added stress to a trip that was supposed to be stress-free.     rmnp and estes are beautiful places.   i love staying along the fall river.    if we go back though, i might consider trying the west side of the park.@ i don't think your penis has shrunk.   it's just not getting the normal amount of blood flow, even when not erect.    when i take something like cialis, even my non-erect state is larger.  ssri's are absolutely cruel when it comes to sexual disfunction.    it really angers me when the ssri labels say \"may cause sexual side effects in some people\".    i think the reality is that they cause sexual side effects in nearly everyone on an ssri.  also, worrying about pssd is going to make things much worse.   anxiety in general can kill a mans sex drive, even without ssri's.@ i have been on paxil for 20 years.    my dr originally prescribed it to get me through difficult times when my wife and i had a troubled newborn and she suffered from postpartum.    it was the wrong reason to put me on paxil looking back.  however, i stayed on paxil because i used to suffer from panic attacks and claustrophobia.   i noticed that they disappeared on paxil.  i originally started on 20mg, which was way too much (no sex drive).   after a month i reduced it to 10mg daily and still had no panic or claustrophobia.    after a few years i reduced it to 5mg and still had positive results.    i have been on 5mg for a long, long time now.    i still have no panic attacks.   however, the drug does impact my libido, even at 5mg.        my advice is to eventually lower your dosage until you get to the point where it still benefits you.   that way, you can at least minimize the negative side effects.@ nice video.   we were on that trail last friday.   but, we never made it all the way to sky pond (stopped at loch).     some of those marmot's don't really seem to be afraid of humans at all.    we were on the ute trail and one of them just came up to us and started digging for seeds right next to us in the tundra.     it's not like he was begging for food.   he just seemed curious and unafraid.   he did pause every few seconds to scan the sky for predators.   it was almost as if he/she felt more safe near humans when in the open tundra like that.   maybe it was just our imagination though.@ that's a great site !   i'll be bookmarking that one.@ i don't have an opinion on the med question.   but, i am with you regarding working from home.    i am getting sick of being home all the time since covid.   and, i just found out today that my company may be making the work from home situation permanent for most of us.  i have a terrific office away from home.    it's the perfect place to getaway.   i really miss the office and having people around.   my depression is also running a big high these days.@ that sounds crazy to me.   it's really simple imo.   long hair represents femininity and womanhood.    most men like women.   thus, most men like long hair on a woman.@ short hair on a woman is totally out for me, unless it is a very feminine cut.   the same is true with women that have hairy legs (rare).  i just can't get turned on by a woman that reminds me of a dude.@ boobs are way down on my list of things important.     i like nice nipples.    i would rather have my s.o. with smaller boobs than really big ones.   and, i am totally turned off by fake boobs that look like fake boobs.  however, with a small percentage of friends that i know, big boobs are the really important.   it's probably the same percentage as women that are into huge penises.@ i always laugh when ssri companies say \"may cause sexual side effects\".  i don't know anyone on an ssri that hasn't had at least some loss of libido.  i am so sorry that you are still having trouble after stopping.   that really sucks.    i can still have intercourse if i make an effort, especially with something like cialis added.   however, trying to have an orgasm is incredibly frustrating and rarely successful anymore.     i used to be able to have 4 to 6 orgasms a day before ssri's.   i used to think being horny all the time was a curse.   now, i would love to have that back.@ i am really interested in this thread also.   after taking a small dose of paxil for about 20 years, my sensitivity and libido suffer.  my t levels are fine.   masterbation has not caused my sensitivity issues.   if i get off paxil for about 4 or 5 days, my libido returns but so does the terrible withdrawal.  getting off paxil at this point is not an option for me.   i am also seriously thinking about adding buspirone to my paxil the next time that i see my dr.@ interesting.  thanks.@ we just got back from the park yesterday and i concur on the bear lake shuttles.    the bear lake and glacier gorge lots were full by 6am.     even the bear lake shuttle lot appeared full when we finished our hike around 10am.@ they just closed the alluvial fan area about a week ago.   it will be closed for a few months.@ we just got back from the park yesterday.   we saw a bear two different times along the fall river road condos.    and, there were muddy bear paw prints on our suv windows one morning (fall river condo).   fortunately, we were told ahead of time to make sure there was no food in the vehicle and to make sure it is locked up.  the owners of the condos are having to bear proof everything right now.  with that said, the bears appear to be more of a nuisance than a danger.@ we just got back from rmnp yesterday.    the ute trail hike was easily our favorite and so much less crowded.     the views were incredible, especially early in the morning when the sky/air was crisp and moisture free.     somebody on here recommended that hike.   if it was you, then thank you.@ you are going to have a great time.  we just returned from our 5 day trip to rmnp and estes (3rd trip).     we hiked emerald lake the first day, loch lake the 2nd and the ute trail on the 3rd day.  the ute trail hike (only 4 miles round trip) was our favorite buy far.   it was both beautiful and not crowded at all.    if you get there in the morning (8am for us), you should have crisp clear skies and incredible views until the moisture/haze starts coming in the late morning.     i just absolutely love this place.   the next time we go back, we will make sure to completely avoid the crowded hikes at bear lake and glacier gorge.@ i have been on only 5mg paxil for over 20 years.   it definitely has affected my sex drive and sensitivity (ejaculation).    it has only gotten worse as i have gotten older.  i believe that most males lose sensitivity as they age also.   however, i know that if i go without paxil for about 4 or 5 days, my sensitivity comes roaring back.     i take testosterone pellets, so that is not the problem.   i am thinking about having my dr add wellbutrin or buspar to my ssri.   at this point, getting off the paxil is not an option.   so, i may try and add another supplement to counteract the paxil.  ssri's can help a lot of people.   it's a damn shame they all mess with one's libido.@ the stanley recently opened the tours back up.   but, they are limited to 10 people per tour.      we are headed to estes in a few day and all the tours are booked.   so, it looks like they will have to be purchased far in advance.@ cheating is bad enough.   however, with honestly and transparency, i feel a relationship can be salvaged.  cheating and lying straight to your face about it ?    that crosses the line and i would be out asap with no looking back.     btw, i am sorry you had to see that video.    i guess the only good news is that it probably did not come as a shock to you at the time.@ i am playing it somewhat safe with my portfolio.   i have moved 1/2 of it to cash temporarily.    i will wait to see what the government does to continue to keep the markets propped up.  i can only see 2 things playing out over the next 6 months:  1) more stimulus packages (and gov buying corporate bonds) keep the markets up, dollar drops further, gold rises further.  \\-or-  2) no stimulus packages, markets crash, dollar stops dropping, gold ?     everything that has happened over the last 4 months is due to #1 above.    can't we all agree on that ?@ it's not the inflation that is the problem.   it is the stimulus packages and the printing of money,     in the last month alone, the euro has gained 5% over the dollar.  also, i live in the us and have a business royalties that are paid in australian dollars.   i see the difference in my larger checks.     gold is still on the rise.   with more stimulus packages coming out soon, i don't think it has capped.    2,000 approaching.@ can i ask where you heard this ?    graniteshares llc is based out of delaware.   the gold vaults for bar are in the uk ?    the founder and ceo is william rhind, who is not chinese.@ thank you for the information.    she refuses to even consider going off topomax.   but, maybe there is something that can be added to it to counter the irritability.@ yep.  this gold rally will probably keep going until the economy starts to turn on it's own.@ one month ago i was also concerned about gold hitting it's peak.    but, i invested in a low management fee gold etf (bar) anyway.   i did this because even though gold has spiked, the dollar shows no signs of strengthening.    i am glad that i did, because i have already had a 10% gain in 1 month.  and, more gov stimulus packages should just drive the dollar down further.   i will probably stay in gold until the economy shows any signs of growth on it's own, without help from the gov.@ i have witnessed this before also a long time ago.    my ex and i flew out of town to a friends (f) 30th birthday party thrown by her fiance (m).    the party was at their apartment and was not large.   a few hours into the party (with alcohol) she went looking for her fiance  and found him fucking her best friend in their own bed.      i am guessing that they didn't lock the door on accident.  or, maybe they thought the possibility of getting caught made it exciting.     all we heard was a scream and then yelling.    i can't believe someone would be that bold to disappear at a party like that to screw your best friend in a fairly small apartment.        it had to be one of the worst birthday's ever.   getting backstabbed by not only your fiance, but your best friend also.    she dumped her best friend but kept her fiance.   fortunately, they did break up before getting married.@ sounds like you have been dating a lot of narcissists.    my wife also says that she used to be a narcissist magnet.@ thank you for writing that.   it does help.     i am sorry that you are in the same boat.     these meds that mess with your brain chemistry can be a life saver for some and a nightmare for others.  i have been on a very low dose of paxil (5mg) for over 20 years myself.   i have tried getting off it a few times (tapering over many months).   i had severe breakdowns from withdrawal the last time i tried and now realize that at this point i am a paxil lifer.     i hope things improve for you both.@ thanks.  i guess that is pretty much the norm than for people on this med.@ thanks.   i am glad that your migraines are getting better  my wife can admit to any of her faults (we all have them).   but, when i mention that topomax has made her appear insensitive, she denies it completely.    i just mentioned this again yesterday to her and she blew up at me and said to never mention topomax again.     she doesn't want to hear anything negative about topomax.   she believes it has made her a stronger person overall.       for example, she grew up with 2 narcissistic moms and has trauma from that.   since taking topomax, she has stopped appeasing them and now has terminated all contact.     she see's her lack of sensitivity as a strength.  but, it has gone overboard imo.     so, it goes a bit beyond just the alcohol at this point.    i know that my choices are to deal with it or leave.     so, i am just going to have to learn to deal with it and grow a thicker skin.@ unless they have changed things in the last 24 hours, you can get there before 6am even without a reservation.   our reservations are for 8am.    my concern is that all the lots will fill up by then, because of the large numbers of people without reservations getting there before 6am.     maybe it won't be an issue.  but, it is a concern.@ thanks for the feedback.     the lack of patience is the thing that i noticed most of all.   my wife can ramble on nonstop for 10 minutes.   but now, if i am talking for 20 seconds, she says \"get to the point\", which gets me flustered and rushed.     sometimes i will type out a letter and print it if i really need to explain something in any kind of detail.    then, she can read it on her own time.   i still cannot believe the almost complete personality transformation that took place after topomax.@ i was put on paxil over 20 years ago to help with anxiety over family issues.  i quickly realized that the paxil eliminated my panic attacks and fear over public speaking.  both positives.  the big negative is the sexual side effects.    at an initial dose of 20mg, i had no sex drive and total inability to orgasm.    at 10mg, i had a reduced sex drive and difficulty with orgasm.  i have been on 5mg for the last 12 years, which is a good balance.   but, my sex drive is still down and i still have trouble with orgasm.    a couple times i stopped taking paxil for about 5 days and my sex drive and sensitivity came roaring back.  be aware that this drug will cause terrible withdrawals, if you are on it for any length of time.   i have tried to get off paxil twice, even with tapering.    it was hell and i realize that i am on it for the rest of my life at this point.  i do think this drug helps tremendously with social anxiety and things related (like stuttering, nervous tics, etc)@ i hate to say this.  but, never underestimate the power that a mom can have on her son's decisions.  my ex-wife completely wigged out on me while we were still dating.    i saw that as a sign that she was probably unstable.    but, my mother really liked her and kind of dismissed the incident as being isolated and talked me out of leaving.  we ended up getting married and within a few months i regretted that decision.  she then became pregnant with our first child about 1 year in.   at that point, i was stuck in the marriage.  i stayed married to her for 17 years, because of my kids.    after we divorced, i found out she was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder.  i am glad for my 2 boys that i had with her.    but from a marriage standpoint, i wasted 17 years of my life, because i did not follow through with my initial intuitions,.  please consider the possibility that your bf's mom could be pulling some strings here.   if that is the case, there may not be much you can do about it if he fully trusts his mom's opinion.@ my ex-wife was sexually abused by her cousins growing up (she capitulated for attention).   it messed her up and she kept it to herself all those years, which affected our marriage.  i left her after 17 years because she was so closed off about a lot of things in our marriage.   only after i  had moved on with another woman,  did she bring up the abuse as a last resort to explaining her behavior and  get me back (so she says).    for years in the marriage i asked her to tell me her big secret that bothered her.    had she been truthful to me early on, it might have made a difference.  my current wife and i hold no secrets.    i don't care what happened before our relationship.  it shouldn't matter.  imo, if this is something that bothers you inside, it can affect your relationship later on and he should know about it imo if you plan on taking things to the next level.   talk to your therapist about how you should present this to your boyfriend.     if your boyfriend is too shallow to understand, do you really want to marry him someday anyway ?  unfortunately, some men are too proud and shallow.    those are also the kind of men that will leave you, if you were to be raped against your will someday.    i am just using that as an example, because i have seen it happen.@ \" everyone is wired differently \"     truer words could not be spoken, especially when your dealing with the human  brain.@ we are coming from out of state for july 28 to aug 2.   both my wife and i already had cv-19 back in march and have also been tested recently for antibodies.    and, we of course know to wear a mask in estes park.  we bought our timed entry tickets the first day that they came out (june 1 i think).    i would be highly annoyed also, if i were a park ranger and found out of state travelers that did not  know about the timed entry system being in place.     nothing is guaranteed to be open and everything requires advanced research and planning these days.   it's shocking to me that some people have just shown up at the park expecting things to be normal.@ i have been on 10mg paxil for 20+ years.   it is too late to get off of it.  so, i am now a lifer.  i still would like to increase my libido and difficulty with orgasm.   i have been reading that a lot of people on ssri's have have success adding buspirone to the ssri.   i am going to talk to my dr about it on my next appointment.  @ you did good.   i have nothing in gold and regret it.      since gold is nearly at the all time high, i am a little afraid to buy in right now.    i am going back and forth on this every day.@ just before covid started, i moved all my 401k small and mid-cap etf's into my s&p 500 etf.    i figured that the us gov was going to try and keep the top 500 propped up during this crisis.    that is exactly what happened and it saved about a 6% loss on my portfolio (which is down 3% for the year).  i got a bit lucky with that one.    as i am 59, i don't have a lot of years left to ride out a long market recovery.@ > maybe she is afraid to lose my income~   this is a thought that i wrestle with sometimes.  i don't plan on ever getting married again.   and, i don't regret marrying my current wife 10 years ago.    when you love someone, you can't help it.     however, i make a very good income (about 200k per year) and my wife can't seem to find her place in the business world as an entrepreneur.  some years she has no income after business expenses, other years very little.    i know that she was very much in love with me when we met.   but after 10 years,  i sometimes wonder if she still has that same love for me, or if she can't afford to lose my income.   before i came along, she was dating a multi-millionaire that wanted to marry her.   she makes a point to bring that up if i ever start questioning things in our relationship, regarding our income differences.        it sure would be nice to not have to worry about being the sole breadwinner, especially since i am quite a bit older and will retire long before her.    i envy couples where both have a steady income.@ paxil  \\-------  good:- no more panic attacks.   more outgoing  bad:-  difficulty with orgasm.  greatly reduced sex drive.  some initial weight gain.horrible withdrawal systems if you try and quit after taking them for an extended time.  also, every ssri is a bit different, even though they are supposed to be similar.   you may need to try a few different ones to find one that works.@ i have always had plenty of male friends.  but, my dating life was shit until i was 26 y/o.    i was a handsome and athletic young man.  had a modeling portfolio from a major agency.    all my friends had girlfriends and/or were having plenty of sexual relationships.     because of my insecurities,  i started dating women that i thought were easily attainable and fell for them.    but, even these women would break up with me.    it never even got to the point of even having sex in my short relationships and i was also very nervous about even having sex.  i was craving a relationship so bad, that i was an emotional wreck at times when i was interested in a woman.   i felt like i was always living in the shadow of my friends, whom all had great dating experiences.  something snapped when i was 26 y/o.   my friends were all off getting married and i was by myself most of the time.   so, i said fuck it and stopped worrying about things.    i started going to bars and social events by myself.    instead of trying to meet women to date, i just focused on having a good time and making friends.   i became very comfortable with myself.   i smiled and laughed, instead of being serious and frowning.     i realized that i loved talking and getting to know women on a personal level, without trying to date them.  so, what happened ?   my entire life changed.   i had more dates than i had time for.    i was dating women that i would have normally thought were out of my league.     my sex life was great.  i was never getting dumped.  i am now in my late 50's.    i work out regularly and take care of my self.    i am on my 2nd marriage, after a 17 year marriage that faded away.   my current wife and i have been married over 10 years.    all marriages have some complications.   but, we are best friends.    and, i have had many people tell me that my wife is the most gorgeous woman they have seen.   i am completely in love with her and only sexually interested in her.    i would not be with her today, had i not had that total transformation many years ago.  being attractive certainly helps.  but, attitude is more important when it comes to dating/relationships.   my entire life changed in an instant, when i stopped caring so much about what people think.    women can detect a confident man a mile away.  and, they are attracted to that.    you can be the best looking guy in the world.   but, if you have a negative attitude and don't smile, you are not going to be approachable.  also, when my friends got married it was the best thing to happen to my social life.    you are not going to meet many women, hanging around your guy friends all the time.  so, you are probably saying \"why are you in the depression group ?\".    that is another story and yes i suffer from depression.   but, i have had a full and satisfying life when it comes to relationships, because one day during my 26th year i stopped worrying about things and allowed my true self to come out in public.  42 years old is not too late to change.    stop worrying about the past and treat today as a new day.@ so, it is ok to park along the side of the road when the trailhead lots are full ?    is this true for all trailheads ?@ there are plenty of good, honest people in the world.   but, they may seem to be in the minority at times.  a liar is a liar.   if you in a relationship and catch your s.o. lying or stretching the truth about things to others, you can bet that they will lie to you someday.   this is especially true if they ever have an affair.    my wife used to tell me while we were dating, that it was ok to tell white lies if it prevented hurting someones feelings.    i totally disagreed with her on that and it was a red flag at the time.    sure enough, she had an short emotional affair 7 years later with an internet stalker (they met once and kissed, but nothing else.   i do believe her because she is very paranoid about sex and disease).     instead of telling me about it, she kept quiet and terminated that relationship.    but, 2 months later i stumbled across one of their conversations that gave things away.   she was also acting very strange at the time.   i would have divorced my wife after catching her, except that she said in her conversations with her male friend that  \"my husband  is my best friend and i will never leave him.\".   she also told the internet stalker only good things about me.  if my wife would have told me the truth at the time, it would have been a minor blip on the radar.    but, it took  weeks of me prodding to get her to give me the full story.   because of that, i told her that i will never again trust her 100% and i won't.    she eventually became fully transparent with all her online accounts and phone to prove that she is not hiding anything.    and, she is very careful when it comes to internet predators and admits that she was gullible before.  it's 3 years later and i am pretty much over it.     as my mother-in-law always tells me, my wife is smart enough to know \"which side of ones bread is buttered\".  i do think she realizes how close she came to losing her marriage.  the lying also reminds me of \"the waiter rule\" that i was told about many years ago.   this rule basically says to watch how the person you are dating treats the wait staff, especially when there is an issue with your meal.    your s.o. will be walking on eggshells with you to make sure that they give a good impression at first.  but, they will slip up when it comes to others without realizing it.    at some point in the future, that is how they are going to treat you.@ best of luck to you !    it sounds like your dr is on top of this.@ the big picture is, you have not been on paxil very long.   so, what i am going to write may not apply to you.   but, i am going to tell my paxil->lexapro story as it was one of the worst experiences of my life.     i started on paxil in 1996 for panic attacks.   initially it was 20mg.  but, i quickly realized that i could get by just fine with 10mg and had less side effects.    14 years later in 2010, i had just divorced and met my current wife.   unlike my previous marriage, with my new relationship we had a lot of sexual chemistry.    i asked my dr at the time if there were any other medicines like paxil that had less sexual side effects (difficulty with orgasm).     he said that i could switch to lexapro with no issues and gave me a new prescription for it.  i asked him about switching gradually.   he said they are in a similar family and should not cause any issues (big mistake).  so, i started taking lexapro and everything seemed fine for a while.   i had no panic attacks and maybe less sexual side effects.    about 30 days after making the switch, i woke up in the middle of the night with the mother of all panic attacks.    most panic attacks only last a few minutes until the adrenaline wears off.     this one lasted about an hour.     i was home alone and freaking out badly.    i have never considered suicide.   but, if i had a gun at that point, i may have ended things.     i wish that i could say that was the end.     but after that major panic attack, the world was a different place.   my anxiety was off the charts.    the world looked unfamiliar and like an alien planet.   i could not keep any food down, only alcohol to reduce the anxiety.      i looked forward to falling asleep every night as that was the only relief that i had.     as soon as i woke up, i just buried my head in the pillow from anxiety and dreaded the coming day.    my fiance (current wife) had no idea what was going on, but was supportive.     after about 4 days of suffering, i returned to the dr and asked if the paxil->lexapro switch could have caused it.    he said no and gave me a prescription for klonopin to reduce the anxiety.    this went on for about 2 weeks total.     at that point i had had enough.   i ditched the lexapro on my own and went back to my 10mg paxil.     within 48 hours my life returned to normal.          i immediately found a new dr after that.     now 24 years later, i am still on the paxil.   i am terrified to stop taking it.    yes, paxil withdrawals can be a total nightmare.       but, i think that main factor has to do with how long you have been on them.   it was 14 years for me when the dr tried to switch me to lexapro.     after the first 5 years of paxil, there was a 2 month period when tried to get off paxil by cutting back the dosage just a bit every day.     i eventually got from 10mg to 2.5mg in 2 months.   but, i felt awful and gave up.  i now realize that i will be on paxil for the rest of my life.   i can't afford to waste an entire year or two of bad withdrawals just to get off of it.     my advice is to get off paxil now if you can.   but, if paxil really improves your quality of life, know that you may be on it for the rest of your life.    once the years start adding up, paxil is nearly impossible to get off of paxil without major long time suffering.     this is not just my opinion, but also others that i have spoken to about it over the years.  best of luck to you@ you might try teledoc ().   that is what i would try.   you can get a doctor by phone or web chat same day.   it is very inexpensive.   they might be sympathetic to your situation, especially if you can prove your prescription.     you will fill out some online paperwork during registration and can put in your regular dr's name.     don't mess with other alternatives.   all ssri's are a bit different.    i learned this lesson the hard way about 8 years ago.  ssri withdrawals are not good.    good luck.@ i have been on 10mg paxil for about 22 years (childs dose).  positives:  no more panic attacks, reduced anxiety somewhat, more socially extraverted overall.  negatives:  all ssri's seem to affect sex drive, life is less exciting, withdrawal can be hell if you ever want to quit.  if you are only on them a short while, quitting should not be difficult if needed.   the longer you are on them and the higher the dose, the longer it takes to get off them.    at this point, i would probably need an entire year of gradual dose reduction to get off of paxil.   i have tried over a period of 2 months and gave up because i could not handle the withdrawals.  good luck either way.  btw-i also take klonopin on occassion which is fantastic and helps with anxiety.   but, klonopin is a benzodiazepine and is highly addictive.   my doctor writes me a script because i promise to only take it twice a week at most when needed at night.    with the drugs half life, twice a week will not cause any (or much) buildup and dependency issues.     i really look forward to those 2 nights a week though.    i wish that i could take it every day, but i know better.@ thanks for the reply.    since you went on june 26, i assume it was a friday (weekday).   i tried to talk my wife and adult kids into getting to the park before 6am.  but, they all rejected my idea.     the last thing that i want to do is waste an hour of my day trying to find parking.  we don't mind the park and ride as long as the p&r lot is not full.     the hikes we plan on taking the first 2 days are from the bear lake trailhead (thursday) and then glacier gorge trailhead (friday) on the next day.    i know that the glacier gorge lot is both tiny and busy.@ i have been on low-dose paxil for 21 years.     i have tried to get off of it several times by very gradually reducing the dosage over a period of months.    i still had awful withdrawal symptoms even after 2 months.      i don't want to waste an entire year of withdrawals to get back to normal.  that is probably what it would take.     i have been on paxil so long, that i have realized i will be on it the rest of my life.    paxil did stop my panic attacks that i used to get many years ago.   so, that has been a real positive in my life.    but, the sexual side effects have been extremely frustrating.      and, i just don't \"feel\" life as much as i did prior to paxil.    i often  wonder how much different my life and relationships would be if i never took paxil .     i suspect that the positives and negatives would probably cancel each other out.     after all, people seemed to get a long just fine prior to the creation of ssri's.   in the end, the only ones really definitely benefiting from ssri's are big pharma.@ yep.   in addition to his t levels, medications can be a libido killer, especially ssri's and some blood pressure meds.@ yeah.   sometimes it is just easier for the man to self service, instead of dealing with rejection.   but, that would not be the case with op's sex drive i guess.@ i would tend to agree with this comment regarding the t levels.    i have been sottopelle pellets for over 10 years now to increase my t levels.    my levels are fine now.  but, my sex drive has continued to decline.   i still desire sex, just not as often.     in my case i also am on high blood pressure medicine and also a child's dose of an ssri.   i believe these 2 meds, plus age, have reduced my overall sensitivity.     the reduced sensitivity makes it hard to orgasm, which leads to less desire overall.         i once went off both my meds for 1 week.    it made me mentally crazy with anxiety and my blood pressure shot up.   but, i was horny as hell.@ sounds like you have been friend-zoned.    that sucks.@ i tell my wife the same thing.    if she would give me erotic pictures, i wouldn't really ever need porn.    i do have a few.    but, she is a bit paranoid they will end up online somehow, which is why she is reluctant to do more.@ we will be doing this hike on 7/29.    we have timed entry passes for 8:00am (thursday).   but, i am concerned that we may need to get there before 6am to get a spot.@ 100% spot on.    or, he is really nervous about not reaching her expectations about sex.  when i was in college, i worked as a bellman in a high end hotel.    we had a lot of newlyweds that came through.     i could often spot those that have been holding out on sex until they were married, because the guy's hands were shaking like a leaf.   when i saw this, i would discreetly ask for the key and open the door for him, because i don't think the groom could have found the keyhole shaking like that.    when i would leave the room, i felt so bad for the couple and just hoped that they had great communication between them, because the pressure of a failed wedding night could easily lead to sexual/emotional trauma down the road if they aren't honest with each other.@ at first i thought he might just be self-conscious about losing his erection during sex.   but, you said he is ok with blow jobs.    so yeah, now i think otherwise.@ i watch porn on occasion.    but, i almost always look for romantic couples porn with kissing and missionary sex.    if the woman looks like my wife, i usually bookmark it as a favorite.  i don't feel guilty at all, because i always fantasize about my wife being the woman in the video.    in fact, i have never had an orgasm without thinking of her.     i know this sounds a bit sappy, but it is true.     fwiw, we had drunk sex this weekend for the first time in 3 months.    what a relief.@ i have to agree with what everyone else is saying.   you could become resentful.  my wife and i were 49m/30m when we first dated.   we met just over 10 years ago, when i was immediately coming off an unhappy 17 year marriage with 2 kids.   at that time, i didn't really want to get married again and certainly did not want any more kids.    my gf (now wife) did not want kids of her own, but was ok with mine.    i eventually changed my mind about marrying again and have no regrets.  we dated 1 year before getting married in 2010.  my ex thinks that my current wife was the reason for our divorce (it was not).  so, my wife has had to deal with my resentful and angry ex-wife regarding my kids over the years.    that is the one thing she didn't see coming and probably regrets.   since both my kids became adults (2 years ago), my ex has been out of the picture~..finally.@ >lake. there is incline, obviously, but it's gorgeous and not overly rocky. your bigger concern may be parking lot will be full by 8. you'll likely need to shuttle from somewhere else. we usually just get t  that is exactly the info that i was looking for.   greatly appreciated.@ we have park a park entry time of 8am for 2 days at the end of july.    can you make the sky pond hike and be back before the late afternoon thunderstorms ?    would you say this is about a 5-6 hour hike at a fairly slow pace ?     thanks !@ ok.  #3 was confusing the hell out of me.  so, i had to look it up.     @ yep.   it's not too late for him as they are not yet married.         op, please listen to everyone.    you have to answer the question as to how important sex is to you.   it is not going to improve with her.  and, you can expect it to become even more rare as time goes on.   this is particularly true if you have kids together.     intimacy and sex are just not that important to some people.   you can't change them.@ nah.   nothing like that ever happened on the teams that i played for.    there was just lots of chatter and everyone kept their eyes up.         btw, there may be nothing smellier than a hockey locker room.    i don't know what it is like at the pro level.    but, some amateur players don't ever wash their equipment and it can really reek.@ yep.   as the much older partner, i would have never made the first move with my now wife.@ i met my wife when she was 29 and i was 48.   i fell madly in love and so did she, without each of us knowing.  i told my friends that i would have given everything to be 10 years younger, just so that i could date her.    my age-gap cutoff point was always 12 years.     so what happened ?     she was the bold one and said that she would like to date me.    because of the 19 year age difference, i thought we would date a while and just have fun.   i thought eventually, the age gap reality would take over.     once i got over the age-gap and me worrying about the \"robbing the cradle\" comments, the relationship just became normal and we are still together today (10 years later).     if you really like this guy, say something.   you have to find out one way or another.   the worst thing is regret.@ >and yes, for example, if my bf was 29, instead of 49, he would be a totally different version of himself. i love the man i have fallen in love. maybe it wouldn't be the same~  this is a terrific way of thinking about it.     my wife is 40.   if i was 15 years younger at 45, we would have not have gotten along as well.   i am sure of that.    but, a 10 year age gap (instead of 19) would have been perfect.@ i totally agree with you.   i would love to have a 10 year age gap, instead of nearly 20 because of health reasons.  i am somewhat fortunate, in that i am still 10+ years younger than my wife's parents.   they have absolutely no issues with our age difference.  i commented on the end of life situation previously.   that is my biggest concern.    i don't want to lose my health someday and pour through our financial resources, which would affect her life down the road.   ideally,  i would love to have 11 more terrific and active years (i would be 70) and then just pass in my sleep, leaving her financially secure for the rest of her life.   it sounds a little morbid.  but, it would be best for both of us.    i really don't want to live if i cannot be active with her, which would also take away some really good years of her life if she had to take care of me all the time.@ my wife and i have a 19 year age gap (59 and 40 now).   after 10 years of being together, we never even think about the age difference.    we enjoy the same things and have great discussions.     like most long married couples at any age, the bedroom action has dropped significantly after time.       i have had a fulfilling life and have accomplished nearly everything that i wanted to.    i finally found deep love (not perfect, but true) at a later age, after a first marriage that was a total mistake (with kids).        i do have 1 major future fear.   the last thing that i ever want to be is a burden on my spouse.   i am still in great shape (and so is she).   but, what happens if my health fails ?     i don't know if i could bear the thought of ever being a burden on someone.     my wife's biggest fear is knowing the fact that i will most likely be gone long before her and she will be alone.   our 10 year relationship is by far the longest she has ever been in.     our concerns are the one thing that everyone will have to face in a relationship with a large age gap.    the biggest issues come up later in life imo.\n",
      "i'm interested in polishing up my spanish as well. sorry i have no suggestions, i'd just like to check in on this thread.@  might interest you.@ my high school had something like that happen except the victim was a random autistic student@ >speculative realism is a big one, particularly object-oriented ontology, though it's had its fair share of critique for sure, and from many corners of philosophy  my knowledge of speculative realism and object-oriented ontology is rudimentary, but based on what i've heard of it i'd really like to explore it (albeit somewhat from a \"mystical\" perspective, if that makes sense). this subreddit probably gets requests for intro reading all the time - i apologize if this question is annoying - do you have any background reading to recommend before getting more into it? and critiques to read later?@ i'm not an academic (yet?) but this is something i think about a lot because my anthropological interests are *literally about activism* and could be heavily informed by more critical theory (which is why i'm studying it for later just in case). however, my main intention is to go into more \"applied\" research and work. i would rather be doing research or some other kind of evaluation for a nonprofit or hospital or something, as opposed to being at a university. people keep pushing me toward an mph degree, but i'm not sure i'm interested in that kind of degree alone. maybe this doesn't answer your question, op, but it is what came to mind first.@ one of my relatives is a jazz musician, so thanks for confirming my first impressions of adorno's argument.@ one of my relatives is a long-time jazz pianist so this argument bothers me a lot. he does have some formal education in music; this argument doesn't make sense even if there are \"rules of music\" you're supposed to \"rebel\" against. i'd like to read adorno at some point anyway despite him being memed, but thanks for pointing this out.@ i haven't read a lot yet because i'm really new to critical theory, but so far i think my favorite is derrida and my least favorite is foucault. some people complained about derrida's presentation style before i started reading his stuff, but i actually kind of like it.  idk, this is probably petty, but something about foucault's writing really rubs me the wrong way - not aesthetically, but it feels a bit \"totalizing,\" if that makes sense - and i really want to figure out why (and if this is reasonable).   also, i don't know if she counts enough for this thread, but someone recommended me an article by sylvia wynter once and found it riddled with inaccuracies about religion. (before getting into critical theory, i read extensively on mysticism and science, especially jewish and islamic alchemy and astrology. reza negarestani actually includes a diagram of the latter in *cyclonopedia.*)@ essays by benjamin first inspired me to read other critical theory, so he's especially important to me.   he was also friends with , who is extremely important to the modern study of jewish mysticism (another topic i'm also interested in).@ just finished *critical animal studies: an introduction* by dawne mccance and *beasts of burden: animal and disability liberation* by sunaura taylor (probably not super \"critical theory,\" but whatever). just started *the animal that therefore i am* by jacques derrida.@ video essays can be very hit-or-miss for me. i don't like just seeing someone talking to a camera, and i don't like it when they talk too fast. also subtitles are a huge help for me but few people think of or have time to include them. unless it's analyzing a movie or video game where you *have* to refer to certain scenes, i'd much rather read an essay.@ *the animal that therefore i am* by jacques derrida@ 1w9. in high school i liked biology the most but i also loved most of the humanities, especially language arts. philosophy was fun on its own, but the teacher was a dick i kept getting in fights with.   in college i majored in anthropology, but i took a lot of classes on history and philosophy as well. i focused on medical anthropology and work in social services now.@ i have actually said the 1 phrase irl@ 1w9 here, i'm too busy cleaning my room@ thank you for being open to my post. there are a lot of misconceptions about bipolar disorder that i often see repeated in the media (i.e., that we're all artistic geniuses and medication will take away our \"spark\").@ i definitely resonate with that. i feel like my instinct to lash out at people completely overrides any social norms or reason.   and that's a great meme, haha@ thank you for sharing - i hope you are in a better place now.@ psychosis isn't known for making sense lol@ i'm sorry you and your brother are going through this.   i can somewhat relate. my dad has undiagnosed bipolar disorder and goes through phases where he is depressed and misuses drugs and alcohol to cope, and manic phases where he gets very paranoid and grandiose and does reckless things (like spending all his retirement money to buy a radio station). he will also never go to a doctor (*any* doctor) because he thinks they will snitch on him to the fbi for knowing the truth about 9/11. but despite being a hermit in an isolated decrepit trailer, he is \"functional\" enough to not be an immediate danger to himself or others, so it's not really reasonable or practical to get him involuntarily committed. (besides, he's so good at pretending to be \"normal\" anyway that he could easily talk his way out). it is heartbreaking to watch because he and i share many symptoms, except i chose to get help and i believe i have a much happier life.   the \"good news\" about bipolar disorder is that, if it's bipolar, your brother's psychotic phase will end eventually, although it will take a very long time without medication. the bad news is that he will probably experience depression instead once's it's over, both from regular effects of the condition as well as shame about his psychotic episode. there are a lot more resources and tips out there for dealing with depression, but i would add that you shouldn't pathologize him (i.e., \"you're just mentally ill, get help\") because that can actually make a person less likely to seek help. if the conversation comes up, emphasize to him that you do not have to have a diagnosable mental illness to benefit from seeing a therapist, although he will certainly get labeled with one. he needs to talk to someone who understands what he is going through, and the best person to do that with is a therapist. if you have had positive experiences with a therapist, you can bring those up too if you're comfortable. if he feels isolated because he feels people aren't listening to him *and* that he is right, he still needs to find a helpful and willing ear, and he might have some other ideas too. (for instance, a leader in his religious community might seem more trustworthy to him, and he might thus trust that person's opinion that he should see a therapist.)   recovery can happen, but the rough truth is that it's very difficult to force it on someone. you sometimes can force someone to get medication, but in my experience those people tend to end up resenting the mental healthcare system for disrespecting their agency and making them take meds that frankly do have difficult side effects for many people. (that being said, there are a *lot* of medications now that work a bit differently for everyone, so he has many options. it took me at least 5 tries to get on a med combination that works.) he has to either get to the point where he *desires* help or the point where his need for safety outweighs his need for agency.   as you're there for him, be sure to take care of yourself as well. the stress that caregivers experience is very real, and you can't help him if you don't help yourself too.   i hope this helps.@ i'm a pseudo-intellectual, so i like reading about critical theory, religion, philosophy, etc. writing essays can actually be an excellent channel for my hypomanic energy, even if the end products don't make sense.   i have a lot of trouble getting in the mindset to read fiction unless it's part of one of those academic projects.@ i don't have a source for this off the top of my head, so take this with a massive grain of salt, but i've been told stimulants like ritalin can accelerate the onset of manic symptoms in people who are susceptible to them.@ did you also like kafka?@ do you have a diagnosis or some support network that can help you?   i hope things get better for you soon.@ of all the parts of my manic episodes, i am most wary of disclosing the part about my violent thoughts because i do not want to increase the stigma that all people with mental illness are dangerous.@ are there any mental health advocacy groups in your area? i don't always agree with the approach of some of them, but they might be able to give you some information that would be good for yourself and your neighbor.@ i still have episodes, but they are much more manageable now. my medication regimen is helpful, but of course a healthy sleep schedule is crucial too.@ i largely agree with you. i haven't had many episodes where i do things dangerous to my life, but i have done illegal things and other stuff that hurt me financially and career-wise.@ i was actually the one who insisted on trying medications because i knew i was mentally ill in some way (i thought i just had depression), but i didn't know what it actually was. i knew i was depressed, but not that i was manic at the same time. the reason i only got diagnosed in college was because i had more independence after i turned 18, graduated high school, and went to college in another state.   the biggest issue i faced, besides having ridiculously anti-psych parents, was that the admins at the school i went to thought i was attention-seeking and/or an embarrassment to their special honors program. they regularly accused me of \"making stuff up for attention\" and at one point recommended i drop out of high school entirely and get a ged instead because \"your personality isn't a good fit for academically rigorous environments.\"   mental health first aid, as another user mentioned, is very important, and people need to be more perceptive of possible mental illness symptoms instead of dismissive or frightened of them. and although it's good to have public conversations about mental health, it's also wrong to deny that people with mental illness have agency; unfortunately, some well-intentioned people take a very paternalistic attitude toward us. also, psychiatry has its own internal problems and is not the panacea that some mental health organizations make it out to be. some people have good reasons to be wary of psychiatry and those reasons have to be addressed too. you can't just tell people to \"get help\" while making things like hospitalization, medication, etc. unattainable or unreasonable, financially or in some other way.@ that sounds like an awful experience. my family is not religious, but i can see how a religious spin on abuse would make it more difficult in some respects.@ both. it was sort of like i was such a genius that the world couldn't keep up with me.@ yeah a full-blown euphoric manic episode for me feels a bit like that time i took a shitton of adderall, but only the good parts plus a little extra~ at first. it's definitely seductive, but it's playing with fire and the depression leaves me nonfunctional.@ i don't have any articles off the top of my head, but the three most important things i can think of right now are  1. validate their emotions, but not the correctness of the delusions themselves (i.e., you might tell a paranoid person, \"what you're experiencing sounds scary\" but not reinforce their idea that people are out to get them)   2. don't make medication or other treatment the focus of the conversation - although it is an ideal outcome, bringing it up can make a person feel more stigmatized than helped (and it's not uncommon for manic people to deliberately avoid medication)   3. don't argue with the person about their delusions or other thoughts being true or not (see above)   once a friend with schizophrenia called me over to their dorm at 2am so they could draw my aura. as they drew they told me about the spiritual awakening they were having and that it was completely changing their life. i think it's important to ask questions about how long they've felt like this, the most \"interesting\" or important details of what they're experiencing - basically things that help a person feel like they're being listened to and not dismissed or stigmatized or rejected. even pre-therapy, i was sometimes aware when other people would find my thoughts unusual, but that didn't change the fact that they were real to me. eventually they chose to go back to a psychiatrist because they weren't afraid of talking to someone without judgment anymore.   i should emphasize though that this doesn't mean you have to be a person's therapist or put up with them being an asshole. you shouldn't set yourself on fire to keep other people warm.@ cultural/literary critic@ i'm sorry this happened to you.  some psychotic episodes have been the most frightening experiences in my life.@ i have type i bipolar disorder and my first episode was a full-blown mixed episode in high school, around age 16-17. what made it worse was that my family doesn't believe in psych meds, so i completely lost touch with reality over the course of a year and it took me another year to recover enough to function without being suicidal. i wasn't diagnosed with a mental illness until college, and not bipolar i specifically until after i graduated. i'm surprised that no one thought of it sooner, given that bipolar disorder runs in my family.   it started with the sleeplessness, boundless energy, and a rapid flood of ideas that initially made me look like a good student, especially at writing and literary analysis. all my language arts teachers loved me. my favorite author was franz kafka.   then that euphoria evolved into pure rage at the world, but on some level *it felt good* - i was just becoming a very hateful and pessimistic person who frequently felt like committing suicide because i couldn't stand all the suffering in the world anymore.   i started seriously believing i was better than everyone else and going to win the nobel prize or something for my writing. the problem was that all my classmates were jealous of me and out to get me, and i could read their evil intentions in the tiniest glance and gesture.   then i went completely psychotic and panicked every day at the thought of someone drugging my food, so instead i spent as much time alone as possible so that i could self-harm and \"commune with god.\" god gave me secret information on who the \"evil people\" were, and how i had to protect myself from them. so i started carrying a hunting knife everywhere, even to school, and probably could have hurt somebody if they pissed me off enough.   there is a lot of advice out there about how to help people experiencing depression (not that all of it is helpful). but there is less guidance about how to deal well with someone experiencing mania or just psychosis in general, because it can be very frightening to others and psychotic people are not known for their rationality.   most people in my life don't know i've been through this because i look like a \"normal\" person - at least until i have another episode that gets bad enough for others to notice. i have not had any episode that extreme for a few years now, thanks to meds and therapy.   i hope this is informative to people interested in the topic. thank you for reading.  **edit:** i would like to get to all your comments, but it may take me a while. thank you for your understanding.@ yes, magic users are very vigilant about maintaining their grimoires because they need them to study and re-study their spells. however, magic outside of narrow industrial purposes is strictly regulated for the general population. you basically need a degree to be legally allowed to practice fancy \"higher magic.\"@ i actually came up with my world precisely because i *don't* like the dark academia aesthetic lol.   there are institutions like abraxas university where magic is integrated into each major in a different way (psychology, biology, literature, etc.). but for the most part, people are only instructed in a few kinds of magic to study and perform repeatedly for the rest of their lives, even at the cost of their sanity. magic is based on memory, but after a spell is cast, knowledge of how to cast it evaporates until it's studied again. pushing your magic too far makes you likely to lose non-magical memories too.@ i recently started a new worldbuilding project rooted in the \"magical school\" trope. basically, i saw dark academia and thought, \"what if this was a magical high school but underfunded and poor?\"@ thank you for elaborating on your system more. i like the free-form (heh) nature of it, and i really look forward to seeing where you go with this.@ \"you should really be more tolerant of people who disagree with you\"  edit: on a more serious note, i hate being told to \"calm down\"@ this is balls-to-the-wall awesome. i agree that gamified magic systems can get a little tiring after a while, and i like it when magic is culturally embedded in a world so effectively.   * how specific do archetypes get? do they roughly correspond to broad elements (fire, ice, etc.) or can they be way more specific (string, quartz, etc.)?   * when you say that an archetype unlocks certain abilities, are all those abilities material or are related \"concepts\" fair game as well? (for instance, would joe's ice abilities extend to him possibly \"freezing\" time?)   * the example of joe seems pretty intuitive, but could you give examples of what magic for an artisan or ruler might look like?   thank you for sharing your work!@ > are you looking to find arguments for or against virtue ethics as a normative theory? are you interested in perhaps adopting a particular theory?  i would say say these two things.@ kinkshaming is my kink@ he's just a white supremacist in a yarmulke.@ shapiro is just a white supremacist in a yarmulke.@ yeah, but it feeds into the reddit narrative of freeze peach under attack whenever the status quo is challenged, which is why it's staying up@ *liber exuvia.* by far. just~ @ * about halfway through *beasts of burden: animal and disability liberation* by sunaura taylor  * just started *mythologies* by roland barthes  * also reading *critical animal studies: an introduction* by dawne mccance@ this might seem like a weird recommendation, but would you consider getting involved in any kind of local activism (i.e., food not bombs). being around like-minded people working toward a goal might help alleviate some of the loneliness you're feeling.@ *braiding sweetgrass* by robin wall kimmerer@ it's typical concern trolling of trans youth.@ she's good at prescribing meds but i feel like she chastises me a lot  (edit: that's my psychiatrist, i don't have a therapist)@ just curious, what parts do you agree with? i vaguely remember reading it years ago and wasn't impressed. it did get me more interested in religious studies and philosophy of religion though.@ right now i am working on an essay about crow cognition. i hope to be able to post it here once it's finished. i've been reading other things though that are informing my work.   last week i finished *braiding sweetgrass: indigenous wisdom, scientific knowledge and the teachings of plants* by robin wall kimmerer. simply put, this book blew me away. it's extremely relevant to discussions on environmentalism, science studies, anticapitalism, etc. and i strongly urge you to read it if you are interested in any of those things.   today i started *beasts of burden: animal and disability liberation* by sunaura taylor. i am a disabled person (albeit with different disabilities than the author) who also has an interest in animal activism, so this book is relevant to more than just my current essay project. to be honest, a lot of what i've read of it so far has elicited a \"no shit\" response, but that could be because 1) i'm not far in the book and 2) the author and i already have some overlapping life experiences and political stances.@ *beasts of burden: animal and disability liberation* by sunaura taylor@ i started a new world! i don't know what to call it yet though, and it's very rough. so far i'm just focusing on the us, or this world's rough equivalent.   in contrast to the one i was working on before, which was mostly non-magical, this one does center around magic. i based it on the idea that educational inequality is one way inequality manifests in our society, so why should it not manifest in certain magical societies too?   magic is not an innate talent, but learned, just like any other discipline. however, unlike other subjects, magic spells are something you forget *as you use them.* when a mage casts a spell, they still *know* about the spell and all the lore behind it, but knowledge of how to cast it evaporates until they learn it again. (a mage that tries casting a spell without memory of it will likely lose a non-magical memory instead, assuming it even works.)   this makes it easy for magic to concentrate in the hands of an educated and wealthy elite who have the resources to access this education. so while there are extremely prestigious universities and prep schools for the rich, the rest of the country is more likely to get a very substandard magical education, if any at all. there's a reason why mages protect their grimoires so carefully.   magical university applications basically consist of offering something as a sacrifice and then writing your application essay on why the ~~devil~~ admins should accept it. everyone who enters magical university has sacrificed something important to them to get there. the nature of what a student offered in their bargain is a closely guarded secret.   once in university, students start to specialize more and more in particular disciplines that are basically like magical twists on the liberal arts. for instance, a physics student might specialize in telekinesis, psychology students learn mind-influencing techniques, biology majors might learn healing, and chemistry majors cast fireball.  idk, it sounds fun.@ unfortunately it can be a very bigoted subculture too. i'm jewish and when i bring up black metal, i'm often asked why i listen to \"nazi music.\"  personally, learning about metal made me appreciate that all music has a craft behind it, even if i don't understand the outcome, just as most other people don't understand metal.@ currently reading *braiding sweetgrass* by robin wall kimmerer. it's quickly shaping up to be one of my favorite books.@ thanks! i went to a decent public school but felt really alienated in college on account of socioeconomic differences; i think part of my inspiration comes from my own experiences and those of many of the friends i made, not just historical knowledge.   basically i also want to subvert the common trope of magic being an inborn (and often hereditary) talent. so in this world, magic ability is more related to opportunity than innate skill.   i'm still wondering what kind of effects magical power should encompass though. i might do magic schools or disciplines based roughly on actual disciplines in the liberal arts (sciences included). the history majors decipher old magical languages, the language arts majors experiment on how to use them, the psychology majors learn more mind-controlling techniques, the physics majors specialize in things like telekinesis, anthropology students are trained to collect knowledge about the \"primitive\" magics of other cultures, and chemistry is where you go learn to cast fireball.@ on my only trip on a greyhound bus, i dozed off but woke up to the sound of one of the passengers beating his girlfriend behind me.@ >i think it's a wee bit unreasonable to deem someone dangerous if they do not ask for permission before doing every single little thing.  and this is why we don't force our kids to hug grandma.   op, you're being abused. projecting the social backwardness that traps you in this situation on everyone else in the thread doesn't change that. you're not progressive or enlightened for putting up with a partner who physically attacks you. you're a victim, and as long as you deny that, your personal issue has no chance of improving. what's the point of asking for advice if you've already resolved to not listen to it?@ a writer (who i don't want to name) recently published an academic book that received a lot of negative press because of some of its content. i certainly don't agree with everything she wrote, but knowing the instability of a lot of academic positions, i thought the backlash she was receiving was largely hurtful and unwarranted. i wrote the author a message of support to let her know that i plan to get my library to purchase the book to financially support her writing, legally protect it, and make it accessible to the general public.@ i'm probably not extremely qualified to answer this question since i'm just getting into it myself. this is not an introductory book, but you might want to check out  at some point.@ haha, makes sense.@ ***representation: cultural representations and signifying practices* edited by stuart hall**  just browsing through some introductory stuff. i'm a newbie.   ***crow planet: finding our place in the zoopolis* by lyanda lynn haupt**   this is a book i'm reading so that i can write a critical essay on it. it will be my first project and i hope to be able to publish it on here eventually :)@ my campus didn't have a chabad rabbi. i've met a few in other contexts but didn't have good experiences with them, mostly related to me being trans (which i guess is to be expected).@ free books free books@ ***representation: cultural representations and signifying practices* edited by stuart hall**  i'm really only reading this as an introduction to cultural studies and critical theory.   edit 10/30/2020: a good introduction for people who have *no* experience with anything related to cultural studies, but i found it a little elementary because i already had some familiarity with some of the concepts and thinkers referred to. (my undergrad education exposed me to some of this stuff.) it's definitely not a substitute for delving into specific topics, but if something catches your eye or you just want to figure out whether cultural studies is right for you, this book might help.   ***crow planet: finding our place in the zoopolis* by lyanda lynn haupt**  i'm learning about it so that i can analyze this book, which i read as a teenager and liked but now am very, *very* critical of. right now i'm writing an essay about its portrayal of crow intelligence.  edit 10/30/2020: i just finished haupt last night. it's an excellent window into the mind of a white middle-class suburban seattleite who derides the \"urban jungle\" while pontificating on her closeness to nature via the crows in her yard. i rarely say a book is not worth reading - if you're interested in different environmentalist perspectives, it might be worth it to read this, but very critically.@ well, of course i'd like my writing to be as good as possible, but that seems pretty typical for writers. my main interest is in social critique and in providing a fresh perspective on some understudied topic so that other people start thinking and acting differently about it.   i was going to go on a ramble about my crow essay, but i didn't want to get sidetracked lol@ nice video! i liked the final comments about video games as an art form. ironically, i've heard other gamers in the past, possibly with more libertarian inclinations, use a similar line to defend games against censorship motivated by concerns about their content. \"it's an art form, so you can't criticize it this way!\" becomes \"it's an art form, therefore you *must* criticize it this way!\" (to be clear, that's not a critique of your video, just something that came to mind.)   also, thank you for adding subtitles. accessibility is very important to me.@ critical race theory really isn't the bogeyman conservatives are making it out to be. there's a lot to criticize about *white fragility* from a crt perspective.@ it's basically woke gaslighting. i've already seen people psychologically abused and bullied using this book as justification.   it's also bad because it locates structural racism in the attitudes of individual white people, and not the biases of institutions as a whole.@ 1w9. most of my creative projects are in writing, especially academic-style writing and cultural criticism. unsurprisingly i'm often inspired to write when i'm deeply dissatisfied with something, so i channel that emotion into something more abstract. i'm proud of being analytical and having original takes that i put a lot of effort into, and i especially like being recognized for it.   for me, this creative outlet is a necessary release, and i get very irritable and frustrated when i can't do it for some reason.   i am currently working on an essay which is, roughly speaking, about crows. yes, i do eventually plan to do an essay on the enneagram.@ i (135) get frustrated every so often, but i can count the number of times i *viscerally* felt uncontrollable anger on one hand. the idea of being swept away by emotion or feeling it manifest in my body is completely alien to me. i am not emotionally moved toward an outward reaction.@ that's still incorrect though. while some tarot readers take a purely psychological approach to interpretation, others do appeal to supernatural beings while interpreting cards.   people who report talking to the dead, or any other deity or spirit, can be found in many, many cultures. there are some similarities and differences between them, but the vast majority of people who engage in this practice do believe they are genuinely interacting with the dead. for some people, it's an integral part of their religion. \"enlightened\" western society is not an exception; as you already know, just because we have certain scientific knowledge other cultures don't doesn't mean that everyone in our culture accepts that knowledge. *we* know that cognitive distortions (which all people are prone to) are involved; *they* are probably not aware of this. in that respect, it's not too different from tarot reading.   i personally know very intelligent people - all of whom have college degrees, if you consider that a marker of intelligence - who report having been possessed by spirits in vodou ceremonies, or receiving visual and auditory visions from god during prayer. these experiences don't really being harm to anyone, and the people i'm talking about are psychologically \"normal\" in every other way as far as i know. just because it's probably an incorrect belief and/or outside the boundaries of we might consider \"normality\" doesn't mean that it's pathological. this is something that psychiatry has struggled with for decades; more recently, practitioners and researchers have become more accepting of other cultures and acknowledge how they influence a patient's experience with mental illness.   t. m. luhrmann is an anthropologist who has written a lot about psychology and religious experiences. one of her books, *when god talks back: understanding the american evangelical relationship with god*, might be of interest to you. the book has received some criticisms, to be sure, but it still might be worth a read.@ i'm not a christian but i find religious vocations very interesting. what made you want to become a pastor?@ just curious (and you don't have to answer this), what kind of religious vocation are you in, and what is it like?@ alright then, *comrade.*@ 1w9 - scholar writing critical social commentaries on niche topics (but a lot of people have suggested i'd be a good rabbi)@ **stereotype:** i'm a puritanical conservative.   **truth:** i'm a puritanical communist.@ 1w9/3w4/5w4, so/sp, ili@ this might not be a popular take on skeptic reddit, but most tarot readers, psychics, etc. are not acting in bad faith. they're not \"targeting\" you like you're their prey. they genuinely believe  - as i did when i was a tarot reader - that they are advertising and providing a service, and like any other service, they should be compensated for it in some sense. when it comes to compensation, there is little difference between a tarot reader and a handyman, for instance.   i stopped because i realized that, while i was good at motivating, encouraging, and reassuring people, i was not really qualified to solve the problems they came to me with, given the information i had from the cards and my \"intuition\" alone (which, as i was figuring out, really is *quite* limited). i genuinely did want to help people though, which is part of why i work in social services now lol.   i still think some of the card art can be pretty though.@ the crystal trade is very unregulated and a lot of the products are mined in very environmentally unfriendly and otherwise unethical ways. as someone who used to collect crystals, this is a major reason i stopped. now i have a bunch of cool rocks, and i would like them to go to good use, but i don't know what to do with them.@ i'm currently reading *representation: cultural representations and signifying practices* edited by stuart hall. i also intend to start *necropolitics* by achille mbembe this week.@ my high school guidance counselor told me to drop out and get a ged because my mental illness and \"difficult personality\" made me \"a bad fit for academically rigorous environments.\" i later graduated college near the top of my class.@ if i had seen this prompt a few weeks ago, i would have been able to answer it, but i've since cut magic from my world. i had been working on a system where magic is based on speaking a language whose name i couldn't decide on. it can only spoken by those who have had their tongue eaten and replaced by a certain  that has been dreamt into existence by the eldritch creature quietly and secretly incubating in the center of the earth. i couldn't decide what kind of magic it could actually *do* though, so i put it aside.  edit: oops, i forgot to basically answer the question~ the tl;dr is that i wanted it to be inspired by natural forces (in this case, the deep sea), creepy animals, and something vaguely lovecraftian.@ good luck!@ i cut out magic. i realized that it was overcomplicating and overshadowing every other aspect of the world, and was actually lessening the world's depth and mystery.@ solarpunk meets lovecraft@ there is a primal monster growing in the center of the earth, sleeping like a chick in an egg. in preparation for its hatching, it dreams up parasitic beings that hijack a living being's mind. these fill the target with a powerful religious fervor to serve the creature by cleansing the earth in preparation for its emergence. symptoms include random acts of altruism, episodes of emotional lability, and the feeling one's self is \"dissolving\" into a chorus of unfamiliar voices.@ lately i have been reading some essays by walter benjamin, but i would also like to read *beasts of burden* by sunaura taylor as well starting this week.@ >  the rabbi at my university is bankrolled by conservative orthodox jews but he spends his time writing about neo-marxist critical theory from a sort of religious existentialist perspective. he has an amazing life.  i am jewish and a theist and this sounds really interesting. (unfortunately, i don't come from a very religious background.) i would love to know more about this guy.@ i'm interested in studying medical anthropology, but i have trouble finding relevant phd programs in that field due to my very niche interests. however, i think my intended topic would work very well in an sts program. do you mind if i dm you to ask you some questions about it?@ have you checked out any ethnographies about physicists before? i swear i have some names on the tip of my tongue.@ cpsc?@ i started in neuroscience and logic before switching to anthropology and linguistics. i only got interested in reading more critical theory after i graduated, unfortunately.@ you might be interested in . i have not read it yet myself, but you might find it relevant to what you're majoring in. if you do read it, i would love to know what you think about it.@ i would love to know as well. a server oriented toward friendly feedback about writing and learning would be especially nice.@ will do!@ i have definitely considered that before, as they have faculty that match my main interests (besides transit).@ he is alone and remote, and has dealt with alcoholism in the past. he also refuses to see any kind of psych professional because he is too paranoid.@ thank you for responding. i have to admit i have not looked into urban planning much, possibly because of the name, but i will do it now.@ thank you for responding and for the links. personally i am interested in qualitative (especially ethnographic) research the most, so i will especially look for things related to that on those websites. do you mind if i message you?@ thank you for the link!@ interesting, thank you. i have never really been a math person and i veer heavily toward the qualitative, the ethnographic, and to some degree the theoretical. (i know it probably sounds weird for someone with autism, but i actually really like the social and outward-facing aspect of anthropology, because it has so much to do with learning about how people interact with each other in varying situations.) gis is unfamiliar territory to me, but if it is relevant to my interests i will check it out.@ thank you for the kind words. may i message you?@ that makes a lot of sense. i would totally be interested in interviewing rural cyclists or something like that. thank you for responding!@ thank you for the tips! i am not sure i want to go to graduate school for this particular topic, since i already have plans regarding medical anthropology and a rather specific topic related to substance use. they're very different from each other, and sadly i think i would have trouble reconciling the two. however, at some point i might start blogging or writing other essays about all the topics that i don't get to \"officially\" explore in academia (assuming i end up there eventually, or maybe not).   may i message you?@ thanks, let me know when you find it.@ really interesting! do you mind if i message you?@ i will look into those, thank you. my schedule is very busy lately but i hope there is a way i can get involved.@ sorry if this is a weird request, but is it ok if i message you? i am interested in learning more about the olympic peninsula and have a side interest in environmentalism.@ thank you for responding. your research sounds very interesting. i'm not sure i want to go to graduate school for this specific interest though, since my other academic interests lie elsewhere.@ thank you, i will certainly look there.@ thank you very much! i have seen ruralhealthinfo.org before but did not look at it a long time. there are some rural areas in my own county.@ ok, thank you!@ ok thanks, i thought i was just a weirdo. do you know of any good books i could read or maybe schools to look at? (i am just curious though and don't want to commit to any kind of grad school at this time.)@ this is so common for people who aren't cis white men that i was personally (and anonymously) interviewed for a book about it. i have an invisible disability.   a lot of doctors in this thread should know that their assumptions about us are the reason why so many people don't want anything to do with them.@ basically, yeah.@ **pleroma**   the general vibe of my world is solarpunk/science fantasy, but i've been in a shitty mood lately, so i decided to throw in something a bit more depressing.   pleroma is a post-apocalyptic earth whose continents are modeled after the possible future supercontinent amasia and maps of various continents post-global warming. humanity lives clustered around the arctic circle, the \"crown of the world,\" from where they find ways to live sustainably with the rest of nature.   the crown of the world is also the working name of the being that secretly slumbers within the planet. earth is simply the egg for the crown, and like any egg, it has to be nourished and incubated for it to thrive. and when the hour is right and the crown is strengthened enough by the (mostly unwitting) care of its people, it will hatch.@ i'm interested in exploring ecology and environmentalism a bit, especially in relation to religious studies and human-animal studies, so feel free to send me an invite.@ lovecraft. the sheer racism of his stories alone can make them hard to read. however, the worldbuilding is excellent even if it is based on some racially coded tropes.@ previously the humans of the land and those living in the deep sea were entirely separate societies. deep sea humans risk going permanently blind when exposed to excessive light. however, during long periods of polar night (all human civilization is centered around the arctic circle), the deep sea humans can roam the surface.@ i do eat similar foods regularly, but i think weighing my food would stress me out a lot to be honest. thank you for the suggestion though.@ science fantasy, with some solarpunk vibes.@ >and tattoos with spelling errors. example were you really there if you think you were their?  not the same thing, but once i saw a guy ranting about how homosexuality is a sin, as he showed off his tattoo of leviticus 18:22.   apparently he hadn't read leviticus 19:28.@ this is why learning about film and its history is important and shouldn't be discounted. otherwise we have trouble gaining perspective and learning from the past.@ >puppetmaster can manifest invisible strings from his fingers to control the movements of things, working best with humanoid targets like mannequins or actual humans. the fun thing about his power is that his puppets share his power and can create strings to puppeteer other things. it's puppets all the way up, man.   *kankuro and sasori would like to know your location*   (sorry for the *naruto* reference~)@ many deep sea creatures are bioluminescent. since deep sea humans have been engineered to possess some of those creatures' genetic material, many have some degree of bioluminescence too. bioluminescent microorganisms are also commonly kept in enclosed spaces to capture and emit their light, and they're cared for much like fish tanks.@ i'm still reading through marx. do you think it's feasible to start and understand this book without having an extensive background knowledge of his work?@ lately i've been trying to get into nietzsche and deleuze, but especially deleuze. i'm starting with his books on individual philosophers (spinoza, nietzsche, bergson, etc.).@ when i was a kid i had a dream about teams of flying motorcycle-riders who would travel through space and time to fight each other to determine \"fate\" - basically whether certain events would happen in other worlds or not, and how they would turn out.@ how are ethnic and racial minorities, if any are recognized, treated in the dprk? what kind of protections do they have under the law? does juche have anything to say about this issue outside of the dprk?@ since you're writing for a d&d setting, my advice would be to not overthink it. if your worldbuilding is getting so complex that it's limiting your players' options to the point that they're having less fun, you should ease up on the worldbuilding. a lot of worldbuilders don't want any contradictions or loose ends, but as a homebrewer you'll just have to accept that the story is not just your creation and that these \"mistakes\" will happen.@ til eating disorders can be solved by some random redditor who studies sports science at uni@ there's really no need to be sarcastic, and at no point did i deny that calorie deficit is an effective weight loss method. the issue with recommending literal calorie counting to everyone is that it contributes to disordered eating in many people (including myself).@ one high school sex ed class involved the students getting into small groups and brainstorming ways for women to not get raped.@ thank you for this. i am very, very tired of seeing calorie counting dispensed as popular reddit advice. people have no idea what kind of harm they could be doing.@ thank you for sharing with the community! please let me know if/when you release a .pdf version.@ there are so many reasons for a person to change their name. i changed my name after i came out as transgender, though i didn't know what name to pick until i had a dream about it. some trans people never change their name.   however, it can become a bit of a hassle if it's not your legal name when you apply for jobs and so on. if you want to thoroughly change your name on all your legal documents, check out .@ unfortunately my introduction to *black mirror* wasn't so great. i was going to watch \"white bear\" with some friends, but one of them who knew me closely forgot to disclose a triggering scene near the beginning. then i dissociated so hard that i actually don't remember the episode.   however, i went back and read the plot later and i thought it was a very cool concept, and an incisive critique of the relationship between the \"justice\" system and the media. i would totally be down to watch other episodes now, a long as i know a little bit about what i'm getting into.@ i like it when the creator comes up with an idea - about climate, species, etc. -  and takes it to a more or less \"logical\" conclusion that has a ripple effect on other aspects of the world. it shows that the creator has made an attempt to come up with a point of view distinct from the one they normally use.   i recently learned about the word *diagesis*, as well as the related word *hyperdiagesis* by matt hills. basically, it's about a world for a narrative so thoroughly constructed that the audience can imagine what takes place off-screen, outside of the narrative. i recommend worldbuilders look into the concept, because as someone getting into critical theory and stuff like that i found it quite fascinating.   also:   >i am not too fond of settings where culture is synonymous with race, and said race have their culture directly imported from an old historical one.  i couldn't agree more.@ ah, makes sense. yeah, it's been a while. thanks.@ yeah, i was aware of that. i went with my convoluted system because the humans are generally low-tech compared to those of our world. there aren't any submarines, for instance.  edit: also, rule of cool.@ for some reason i'm envisioning some poor recipient being the victim of a barrage of tiny boxes full of letters.@ i just started *the history of sexuality* by michel foucault and want to start nietzsche too. (what's a good place to start? i have copies of *ecce homo*, *on the genealogy of morals*, and *thus spoke zarathustra*.)@ * *sweet tea: black gay men of the south* by e. patrick johnson - i posted my thoughts on this book a few weeks ago .   * *the history of sexuality* by michel foucault - i know foucault has a reputation for verbosity, but i'm actually finding this very readable.@ goodrick-clarke wrote some pretty good books on the academic study of western esotericism.@ these are also really good observations. i agree with you.@ i think i should explain in more detail. i, too, am speaking from my own experience as a user of relationship subreddits and as someone recovering from abusive family relationships.   i have no doubt that the people who post in rbn are legitimately trying to cope with abusive relationships. what i object to are some of the ways the subreddit culture encourages them to deal with this.   first off, assigning people extremely stigmatizing diagnoses like npd (or bpd to a certain extent) just for acting problematically in a serious conflict isn't just irresponsible armchair psychiatry. it's damaging to people diagnosed with or labeled with npd as a whole. contrary to popular belief, \"narcs\" are not uniformly inhuman and malevolent creatures incapable of orienting themselves toward truly positive relationships. we as a society (not just reddit) need to seriously rethink how we conceptualize \"personality disorders\" and how we construe them as innate flaws, as opposed to morally neutral \"diseases\" (i.e., nearly everything else in the dsm). it's an incredibly dehumanizing and fatalistic approach to relationships that is often taken as a shortcut to avoid actually seeing conflict from another person's point of view. this does *not* mean you have to sympathize or agree with people's reasons for acting abusively - it just means that reducing someone's motivations to a caricature is not a realistic approach to the situation.   secondly, rbn's classificatory system that extends to \"enablers,\" \"golden children,\" etc. results in a similar oversimplification of complex and dysfunctional family dynamics. people who fall into this trap of black-and-white thinking may come to believe that they are incapable of contributing any harm to the relationship or to others (or at least not voluntarily), or that people who do not immediately and completely come to \"their side\" are *automatically* co-conspirators in abuse, or that people who defend the person acting abusively are in no way abused themselves (and may even somehow benefit from contributing to the poster's suffering). isolating oneself from family, whether temporarily or permanently, is a necessary and life-saving step for many people. but rbn's classificatory system, when liberally applied, has the potential to unnecessarily hurt and alienate bystanders in posters' relationships.   as for the sexism, that's more of a /r/justnomil thing, though it does seep into other subreddits occasionally (probably due to the overlap in user base). the fact that one of the most popular relationship subreddits is specifically dedicated to criticizing *women* - particularly older ones who may also be characterized as mentally ill - is extremely telling. women are already expected to be better at and more responsible for relationships than men; a woman who fails to be a good maternal figure, regardless of whether or not she's actually being an asshole, is not just a toxic family member, she's a special brand of musty feminine evil.   there are other things to mention too, but these are just the observations that came to mind first. i hope this post clarifies my thoughts a bit.   and, uh, unrelated, but happy cake day.@ i remember seeing a mod on a coronavirus subreddit say it was *official subreddit policy* to dissuade people from going to blm protests because they were a threat to public health.@ reposted from above but:   fucking this. i can't stand any of the \"dysfunctional relationship\" subreddits, including the justno network and /r/raisedbynarcissists. they made my existing relationships *worse.*  also, i find it very interesting how the most popular of the justno subreddits dedicated to specific family members is dedicated to criticizing women. all other family members go to /r/justnofamily, but mils are a special brand of rotten feminine evil.@ don't even get me started on their discord server~@ /r/raisedbynarcissists sucks too though.@ reposting from above:   fucking this. i can't stand any of the \"dysfunctional relationship\" subreddits, including the justno network and /r/raisedbynarcissists. i say this as a former poster on both. they literally made my life, relationships, and outlook worse.   also, i find it very interesting how the most popular of the justno subreddits dedicated to specific family members is dedicated to criticizing women. all other family members go to

*real* bad guy.@ i have never come across a good subreddit for dealing with dysfunctional relationships. /r/raisedbynarcissists is definitely one of the worse ones. even when i was emotionally stuck in the justno network, i couldn't imagine dealing with the vortex of rbn.   i have no doubts that the people on these subreddits have been in abusive or otherwise toxic relationships. but double standards, internalized abusive patterns, sexism, and other ugly monsters run rampant.@ this might be a weird entry, but here goes:   there's  (1914) called *the dybbuk* or *between two worlds* by s. ansky. the setting is based on extensive ethnographic work ansky did in hasidic jewish communities. the story extrapolates from existing jewish folklore, history, religion, and mysticism to produce a very believable story with elements that are nonetheless original. in one sense it is complete fantasy, but for many of the people ansky interviewed, it wouldn't be too far off from reality.   i really like it when worldbuilding projects draw from and build on real-life examples and problems.@ my partner introduced me to adventure time, saying that i would like it for the lore. i was skeptical because it seemed like a regular kid show, but it's now one of my favorite worldbuilding projects.@ sounds neat! it reminds me of how blacksmiths have been associated with spiritual power in many cultures.@ >in a world of long-distance tech, how can anyone live normally, having to traverse potentially millions of miles to see their family?  define \"normally.\" this concept is extremely contingent upon circumstance. you know how people keep fearing that the effects of coronavirus are \"the new normal?\" the humans of your world have also undergone an event that has changed their lives dramatically. they then found themselves in a new environment and had to *adapt.* so what may be normal to them is made out to be plausible, but not normal to us. this is the hallmark of a lot of science fiction too, imo.@ >basically i want to know (exactly) what \"technological levels\"/time period corresponds with what type of clothing. with more in depth explanation on what each of the technological advancements and methods have had on the evolution of clothing.  fortunately, there are many anthropologists who study clothing and fashion. unfortunately, it's not my field of expertise and i can't name any off the top of my head. but if you are looking for something in particular, i might be able to point you in some direction.  it's expensive, but if anything in the table of contents intrigues you, you might be able to find more accessible work by that author.@ human reproduction is greatly altered in deep sea conditions. because they are descended from small populations with tendencies to form isolated communities in the urban trenches and around the hydrothermal vents, inbreeding is a serious concern. furthermore, humans, although they have mastered genetic engineering, have more difficulty conceiving via \"natural\" reproduction than surface humans. many humans are born from broods created using genetic material from at least two adult humans. as for natural reproduction, there are also a number of social regulations in place that vary between cultures. these range from exogamous moiety systems to enforced chastity and more.@ franz kafka. seriously. i was experiencing a lot of bullying and psychosis in high school, and the aura of alienation and confusion permeating kafka's writing deeply struck me. learning about kafka's life made me feel like there was precedent for me to exist in the world.   literature can have a powerful effect on a person. it needs to be taught.@ i marked the \"other\" option. my worldbuilding is an experiment in , which has a distinct meaning in some disciplines, such as film theory:   >the spatio-temporal world depicted in the film. anything within that world (such as dialogue or a shot of a roadsign used to establish a location) is termed diegetic whereas anything outside it (such as a voiceover or a superimposed caption) is extradiegetic. this distinction is especially associated with diegetic sound: for example, when a record-player is shown to be the source of onscreen music. a diegetic audience is an audience within the depicted world.  if you're engaging in any kind of worldbuilding and presenting it to an audience - *including on here* - you're engaging in diegesis. i was personally very surprised (and pleased) that worldbuilding could be considered so related to critical theory.@ in this setting, the sun has made much of the earth's landmass too hot for humans to inhabit. some of those humans chose to genetically modify themselves to adapt to living in the deep sea instead, away from the reach of the sun's scorching rays. this makes surface humans, the precursor race of the world, rather advanced before their civilizations crumbled. their deep sea descendants view the \"overworld\" creatures as dry fleshy two-legged crabs, degenerate offshoots of or cousins to themselves, the only and true humans. contact between the two is almost exclusively limited to some surface humans leaving gifts to the \"sea spirits,\" which in turn help stimulate the deep sea economy.@ yep!@ yes, my current world uses this trope. it centers on the civilization of deep sea humans that now consider their land-dwelling ancestors degenerate offshoots, and the rest of their continents some kind of dry and hot hell.@ many technologies we use on land are not compatible with deep sea life. for instance, even though iron can be useful to us, it is not a worthwhile investment because of how it rusts in water. however, humans are very adept at biological augmentation, experimentation, and manipulation. coral and bone are the most common materials used for construction, though it's not uncommon for humans to take advantage of naturally occurring caves and fortify them with those materials as well. the choice of coral species is considered to be of especially great aesthetic importance, and bone can be scavenged or, more frequently, grown.@ some human civilizations that genetically engineered themselves to live underwater have been in the deep sea for so many generations that they've forgotten where they come from. they see themselves as the true humans, the pinnacle of evolution, and consider the dry weaklings from the overworld degenerate offshoots or cousins.@ i read \"the presentation of self in everyday life\" in undergrad, and i'm familiar with goffman's work.   may i dm you?@ thank you for the resource. my background is also in the social sciences with a smattering of philosophy. i've read *some* of marx's work, but not a lot. i'm also currently reading fanon, but i also intend to read foucault and then achille mbembe's *necropolitics* (which is relevant for a larger project i'm working on). personally, i like to read and compare \"conflicting\" authors firsthand, and only use secondary sources if i am having trouble following the text.   i will definitely read fromm. i have a  to write about, so hopefully that will spark some ideas.@ i consider myself disabled due to my chronic pain, mental illness, and what i like to call my \"part-time\" visual impairment. i am happy to give my $0.02, but my opinion will never be representative of the views of all disabled people. i second your friends' and the other users' suggestion to watch videos and so on to learn about a diversity of lived experiences.   i don't think any of what you've *specifically* asked about is particularly ableist. the real question is how you are going to differentiate *your* attitudes from the attitudes of various people within the world you are creating. it is 110% possible and ok for you to avoid ableist attitudes and still have a world where eugenics, for instance, is the norm. what matters is how you portray these things, not *always* what is being portrayed in and of itself. constructed worlds are frequently full of racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression, and most people don't bat an eye. if you handle the topic of ableism well, what's the problem with incorporating it into your world?   what may also help you is looking more into disability activism and disability studies. these fields have done a lot of work on many problems related to disability, including the question of    asking this question can be really awkward, but it's good you posted it.@ (not so) fun fact:  refers to how some communities remain racially segregated in the united states. one of many overall depressing facts about the world today~@ you might be thinking of *the right to maim* by jasbir k. puar.@ seconding this book. it's really awesome.@ i don't know much about amplifying voices, but i do know that  has been used to amplify the sound of various instruments.@ being a geographically illiterate pacific northwesterner, i don't know much about massachusetts, but i do think this is a fun concept and wonder what kind of pokemon can be found there. do you have any lore on that?@ thanks, these people look interesting.@ invisible disabilities and other conditions are more common than a lot of people think. you deserve friends who don't make negative assumptions and don't make you feel bad for taking care of your health.@ the design looks like a goth version of the  of the spanish inqusition. or the ku klux klan. based on the lore you provided, both references make sense. nice work!@ i am not very knowledgeable about true crime, but a friend of mine is very interested and plans to buy this book.   on the adnan syed case, however, apparently *serial* left out details  i'm a newbie to true crime though, and don't know much about the syed case, so i can't say if this is accurate or not.@ if you don't mind me asking, why is chizuko ueno so controversial? i am not super familiar with feminism in japan.@ i distinctly remember that washington state also has cape disappointment and poo poo point.@ that's tragic. even if i don't completely like the style of an old building, i still think it should be preserved somehow if possible.@ that's gorgeous, thank you!@ i'm personally a huge fan of art deco and think the style can put an interesting spin on just about anything. imagine a  in the , or , or . sleek and futuristic, almost celebratory of human achievement, but never boring to look at.@ this kind of question is hard to answer because pretty much any worldbuilding idea can be handled very well or very poorly. both of your ideas look like excellent starting points, but that has less to do with my own interests and more to do with wondering where you're going to take these projects. do you want to make a world for yourself or for others? do you intend to write it, draw it, put it in a game, or something else? regardless of what you choose, execution is going to matter at least as much as content, if not more, especially if you intend to present this to an audience.   good luck with your project(s)!@ this probably isn't the kind of feedback you want, but when i saw the bee i thought it was oddly cute? i'm not sure what kind of tone your world is going for, but the purple in particular made it look less \"serious\" to me.   however, i think your style and method are great, especially if you're just getting into design. definitely keep the art coming!@ this feels so strange to read in the middle of a pandemic wrecking the us. great lore and immersion.@ those fragile, spindly creatures living on those bright, dry desert peaks of the overworld aren't evolutionary degenerates of the human species. they are the *original* humans, remnants of the era before their numbers were decimated by plagues. other descendants of those humans genetically engineered their offspring to adapt to living in the deep sea, far from the surface world's dangers. those \"gifts\" that the overworld humans leave at outposts aren't acts of altruism or even attempts at trade; they are offerings to placate the \"sea spirits,\" so that their own fishing will be plentiful and their people safe on ocean travels. milk, honey, and grain are popular offerings because the deep sea humans can use them to study and emulate surface food; this, in turn, reduces their reliance on fish and overworld human bodies.   the majority of humans now live on abyssal plains interrupted by densely settled trenches. physical barriers and stark cultural differences also lead to mutual misunderstandings. not only do few humans travel to near the overworld, but they would be reluctant and/or unable to interact with the humans there, even if they did desire to. the deep sea humans are only concerned with the perpetuation of their stable and highly stratified society. a rough equivalency would be how crows might leave you shiny things if you're nice to them, but more alien; a deliberate transfer of resources has obviously occurred, but it's questionable that we can understand their motivations or how they view their world.@ >does it focus on any particular region in the south? or the whole south?  the book encompasses the entire south.   >and any particular timeframe?  what's particularly interesting about the book is that the age range of the storytellers is very wide, ranging from young adults to elderly people. the younger ones provide a more contemporary perspective on how the lgbtq+ community currently treats black men, but the older storytellers are especially fascinating to me because they challenge a lot of preconceptions modern readers might have about homophobia in black communities, especially in the south.   >and where does the source material come from?  the author personally interviewed storytellers who he found through his (very large and connected) social network. i personally think this method makes sense considering that he is trying to get an idea of lgbtq+ *community,* which entails that the storytellers are connected to the author and often to each other in some way.@ *sweet tea: black gay men of the south* by e. patrick johnson. it mainly consists of the oral histories of other men though, so the author/compiler doesn't comment so much. however, i find the backstories behind how he found each interviewee very interesting from a methodological perspective.@ i was personally interviewed for a book about the mistreatment of women in healthcare. i got my period when i was 11 and had worsening lower back and hip pain ever since. my mom didn't think there was anything abnormal because she had been taught by her family that periods were supposed to hurt - apparently it was common for the women in her family to stay home from work and need full-blown painkillers during their menstrual cycles.@ my dad can't decide whether covid-19 is a bioweapon or a hoax. he also thinks he will protect himself from the disease with a cocktail of zinc, tonic water, and vodka. it's really frustrating, and might be related to alex jones.   a long time ago, i believed some of the same conspiracy theories my dad did (and still does), namely 9/11 and anti-vaccine theories. for a high school english class, i wrote a persuasive essay about how 9/11 was an inside job. eventually i gave those views up, partly due to teenage rebellion (yes, seriously) and partly because i realized how unfeasible and impractical so many of these theories were. they also failed to account for *real* problems i started noticing evidence for in my life, like the complexities of middle eastern geopolitics and the management of infectious disease.   conspiracy theorists aren't just motivated by a simple need to feel smarter than sheeple; they are also fundamentally concerned with the fate of the world. people who believe covid-19 is fake don't think that way because they want people to die from the disease, but because they want our chaotic and challenging world to be stable, understandable, and controllable. i don't mean to insult anyone, but some of them are eerily reminiscent of the spirit behind religious explanations for the existence of evil in the world - often bizarre to outsiders, but not motivated by simple malice either. they often have an apocalyptic quality, with themes of separating the pure enlightened or elect from an irreparably corrupted world, so that an utopian era can take its place.   some of this might be old news to you. i just wanted to get off my chest what i speculate as a former conspiracy theorist.@ or \"you're a jew.\" for some reason it's wrong to use the proper noun \"jew\" when referring to jews. if i had to guess, it might be because \"jewish\" is an ethnicity and a religion, whereas it's ok to just refer to people of other religions by the name of their religion (i.e., \"i'm a buddhist,\" \"you're a christian\").@ i'm jewish and have never found this offensive, or known anyone else who considers this offensive~ do those people really exist, or are they a figment of the conservative christian imagination?   i do like answering with \"happy hanukkah\" as a joke though.@ i'm also disabled and i agree - i hate walking on eggshells when talking about my own damn life. when i started developing a visual impairment, i felt a lot of anxiety about using the \"correct\" terminology to refer to myself - not around other disabled people, but around abled people. (i personally use the word \"abled\" unironically just because it's less clunky than some other options.) eventually i just settled on \"visually impaired\" because it felt like the option easiest to use in a sentence. when people say \"person with \\_\\_\\_,\" it's not the end of the world, but it does feel a bit awkward.@ yeah, i actually agree with you there. i also lost a lot of respect for pinker when he started spouting misogyny.@ >steven pinker ~ cannot step outside his own misconceptions of the world and shift perspective in any meaningful way.  pinker has had his own share of criticism too, though for somewhat different reasons. at least pinker is actually an academic familiar with many subjects (though that obviously doesn't stop him from saying silly stuff).@ i was never a gladwell fan, but i didn't know he worked for big tobacco. damn.@ interesting. i don't think i'd want to live in israel, but i wish the united states (my country) would have more even debates and discussions about the inclusion of religion in the classroom. some schools have comparative religion classes, but my schools never had any, so i'm not sure if the students ever get to actually read from scriptures.   the issue is when *some* christians don't just want the bible taught in school, they want their entire religion to be taught in school. (at the very least, they think teachers should have the \"freedom\" to push it on their students.)   i live in the most nonreligious region of the country though, so i've never personally seen this happen, but a lot of people look at me funny when i say the bible should be taught in school. at the very least, there should be sections assigned in history class so that students can learn firsthand how religion has influenced society.   i tried learning some 3d software when i was a kid, but i forgot all about it.@ this is the start of a horror movie.   in all seriousness though, would you be willing to post pictures of the crosses? i really like religious art and artifacts.@ damn, that's awful. sending kids back to in-person school is such a negligent thing to do right now. are you able to move?@ this kid's gonna get a disease. humans are not built to subsist without *some* vegetable food.   i'm vegan and i don't like salads, but is there any way to get him to eat stuff with beans and stuff like that?@ i'm not a spiritual person, but sometimes i go to new age bookstores to do the same thing. people-watching can be fun.@ not at all!@ i'm a little confused by your comment - did i say something wrong?@ i'm not a psych professional, but maybe daydreaming is an important emotional release for you. whether it's a healthy one, i can't really say.@ head on over to /r/worldbuilding! there are lots of like-minded people who enjoy coming up with ideas for their own sake.@ i use that site occasionally. thanks for all your help!@ good to know, thanks. i had some reading guides on another computer that is unfortunately kaput now, and i don't remember who wrote them.@ thank you, i have been reading some selections from a reader i have.@ > if you are going for a specific approach this sub could probably help recommend particular thinkers.  this actually started because a friend of mine *really* likes deleuze and guattari, but when i read *anti-oedipus* i felt like i was having a stroke. i'd like to work my way up to understanding d&g, or at least well enough to understand how their work is applied to other topics. i'm the kind of person who needs concrete examples first to demonstrate a concept. your part about practice at critical theory is what i'm trying to get at.   >you can read a lot about a topic and then use your objects of choice (d&d for example) to help explain both at once.  personally, i lean more toward writing for a lay audience, because when i have an interest - especially a niche one - i want to share it with as many people as possible. but i'm fine with tackling a topic from either a lay- or theory-oriented direction. i know this isn't a perfect guideline, but my \"rule of thumb\" is that if i'd have trouble explaining the whole thing to my mom from beginning to end, it's probably written or structured in a complicated way. that's not necessarily a terrible thing, but it is something i try to be aware of.   thank you for the recommendations. i will definitely add them to my media list.@ i'm not a gamer, but maybe /r/getdisciplined or a related subreddit can help you?@ i am trying to get into critical theory, but i have trouble picking out where to start. i'm reading one module a day from  just to see what intrigues me the most.\n",
      "hitler? oh hunny. look at obamas little followers and you tell me who the real hitler is. but in all seriousness, you as an american in his 30s wouldnt know what a real dictator was if it smack you in the face with a wrench. my boyfriends family is from russia and his grandparents/great grandparents lived there during the soviet union, his father is 77 and his grandparents are long dead~. trust me, with biden youre going to be living not in the usa but in the ussr, commie. @ maybe itll be like the pilot episode where they save people and hunt things???@ not sure why youre being downvoted. i agree. as a christian myself it can be confusing at times and feel a bit blasphemous. but i think thats why the show calls him chuck. i also have to remember it is a show and god is nothing like chuck. plus some of chucks powers dont add up. he cant hear sam and deans thoughts, he cant read deaths book, god would know the plans of everyone~ because god knows our past, present and future before we were even conceived. i think of god as more the way bruce almighty portrays him in some sense. its a story. @ buffy had the same problem and it was annoying.@ i laughed so hard imagining sam and dean dancing for 2 hours straight! lol@ for me itll always the season finale of buffy, because it was never a true ending either.@ as someone who only started watching this show 2 years ago and didnt get why everyone considered season 5s ending to be the ending~ i get it now. i love all the extra seasons we got, but i do now consider the season 5 finale to be the end.@ thats our god. chuck from what ive realized has somewhat more limited powers. and to be fair, you cant write a story with real life gods abilities into a show~ it just doesnt work. thats why chuck sometimes cant do certain things in supernatural or doesnt know about stuff like plans and thoughts. otherwise, it would be rather pointless if he could do all that~@ in the episode lie to me, he was noticeably paler. but he was angel~ not angelus.@ oh dang! thats a long time. then put your two weeks in, explain to the supervisor that youre no longer interested in keeping your roll and you found something else. i dont know what they want from you (besides the obvious which isnt their business). people change jobs all the time, in fact the average person changes to a new job like every what 3 years or so? change is good.   if ever in the future an employer calls up your old job, they really cant say anything bad about you. you worked for 10 years and left on a good note. an old employer is not allowed to bad mouth you to a new employer like that from what ive been told.@ just lie and say youve worked at your last job a little longer than you did. or use a friend/siblings job to fill the gap in. trust me, unless theyre anal, theyre only going to glance at how long youve worked somewhere and move on to your skills, personality, knowledge, etc. my dad does interviews as a coastal branch manager for his corporation. and he told me it doesnt matter if you stretch a place out for a year or whatever and lie~ youre better off.   employers will briefly see you worked somewhere consistently and will go good. and unless they employer is an absolute weirdo, theyre not putting a magnify glass up to your track record and going hmmmmmm. if they are, you dont want to work there anyway, theyre nuts. they just want to see youre not going from working at place a for 1 year, then place b the next year and on and on.   the world isnt going to end if you say you worked somewhere a little longer. everyone lies. every single person lies on their resume and linkedin. i see friends on linkedin who had amazing jobs or great skills who still lie on their profile. only i know because i know them personally~ but the future employers dont. who gives a rats ass? you shouldnt. my brother is an accountant and before he got a really great job, he lied and said he worked at some basic company for 1 year he never did that his best friend worked at. he then used my mom, my sister and his friend as references. big whoop! his company still hired him and hes since left that job and moved on to an even better job now. that was 8 years ago. life went on.  if the company is weird about your gap or if they assume youre lying for whatever reason, f em and move on. you wont ever see them again, anyway.  another thing you could even do is say you were working mediocre jobs while in school or took off work for school.   sorry if im not a big help. i went through clinical depression and i have bad anxiety, so ive been in your shoes where i didnt work for periods of time.@ uhhhhh. just never show up again. you did your part by telling him youre leaving, and he acted like a toxic little bitch. sounds like a trash boss.   so like i said, say goodbye and never look back. you got another job anyway, so youre keeping the paychecks rolling in. you dont need them for anything any longer and thus you dont owe your old company anything. the fact that your boss acted like a partner with abandonment issues is a enough of a red flag that i wouldnt show up again. bounce the f outta there!@ she thinks its 1960 where you stay at a job as an entry level for 30 years. and probably since were both female, that entry level is good enough for most women for their entire lives. thats the vibe i got from her. definitely the type of woman who never worked a day in her life til she hit an age where her husband could no longer care for her.@ lol no i was the person being interviewed. the person interviewing me was an old hag. she was definitely my grandmas age and she was weird and old school.@ exactly!@ this actually has happened to me. its depersonalization/derealization. i have an anxiety disorder and when the same thing you mentioned happened (they talk 100mph and never take a breath or stare at me in the eyes intensely) i have gotten almost a panic attack from it.@ my mother always said that they want to have control and power over you. and letting you stay at home working is giving up that power~ so no.@ i have social anxiety too. badly. i took anti-anxiety meds and you should talk to your doctor about that. im off them right now, and interviewing is still hard for me~ i get panic attacks from them (i wont go too much into it). but i trudge through them. i forced myself to be confident and speak to people.  try getting a job maybe hanging clothes in department stores (not cashier) or the guys who lug stuff in from the back (kind of like the warehouse dudes). another is a bus-boy at a restaurant. they dont talk to anyone, they just clean the tables and carry stuff out. or a cook for mcdonalds, chick fil a, panera bread, etc.   my ex boyfriend worked for amazon. its very tedious and tiring job. its pure labor. youre better off doing restaurant or retail. its true, you dont talk to anyone~ but im not sure about the interview part. i still would talk to your doctor about your anxiety.@ its a silly question in all honesty. if a person is working at mcdonalds or macys they meet customers who are nice or coworkers who are funny and cool. thats about it. ive worked in retail a lot in the past and never had a wow moment. i still cant think of anything right now. most days were the same. customers come in and buy, complain or ask questions. some are rude and some are pleasant. but no one was ever remarkable where i remembered them~ not even close. though i do remember bad employers and bad coworkers.@ i go the judge judy route. i yell im talking!. it usually shuts the guy up.@ he did ask me to meet up. like oh im staying here. maybe we can meet up this week. i told him i was busy and we had a lot of plans going on and then we were going on a boat to another island a couple days later - which was true. i just wanted to be away~ thats what it was about. he wasnt my best friend or something. he was just someone i knew.@ thank you!@ agreed! thanks!@ wow! thanks! this makes me feel a lot better. i literally felt like crap after that guy said im weird for ignoring him. he also got annoyed that i never really wanted to hang out and now im kinda realizing its just because i didnt care enough to be more than acquaintances. i think hes a fake person and i dont want a friend like that in my life.@ yup! actually i live in a really nice upscale town  in florida. so i think its funny when i got warned that its all white trash. ummm, okay, its a big state and its not near me! all the grass on the sides of the roads are trimmed, shops everywhere, people smiling and walking around, tons of new developments, everything is like something youd see in a tv show. perfectly in place.   when i lived in mass it was like living in west virginia with mountain people and trash. i didnt grow up in massachusetts, thankfully, but i was living there for several years. old buggy trails, with untrimmed roads, trees sticking out, the roads would be broken with loads of potholes that would stay like that forever. people were rude, mean, ignorant, inconsiderate, unwelcoming and cold. the towns were all old mill towns, dilapidated and lost with triple decker houses everywhere. it either looked like baltimore md/gary indiana or west virginia. hallmark and calendars always try to make new england/mass/boston seem upscale and thats laughable. only about 10% of that state actually looked nice. the parts you cant afford unless you make 7 figures.   most of the beaches are cold year round, full of syringes on the sand, no money put into anything, beaches or city. the engineering up there sucks, the roads are like navigating rainbow road in mario kart but with potholes. my family referred to most massholes as broken wheels, because everyone seems to have some sort of medical disorder (and every town has a hospital which is not a good sign). youd see like all these people just aimlessly walking in many of the towns out there, even when its in the negatives. because heroin and drugs are a big problem. i know they say florida has a drug problem, but massachusetts really does~ as does nh and ri. they say its because theyre bored since it snows and theres not much to do unless you live in boston (which is a boring city too).  i tell people how its ironic that theres florida man memes when i have yet to meet one personally, but all i ever did was meet florida man types people in mass. its made me realize how happy people are, how less angry people are. i was so used to everyone around me being miserable and cold blooded. i forgot that it wasnt always like that from where i grew up before i moved to new england. there are happy people in this world, they just dont live in massachusetts. lol.   end of vent/rant.@ cant watch it. you made it private. keeps saying i need to sign in only if you granted access. dont post up unless its public.@ she has that karen voice that i cant explain imo. its not a sexy voice or sultry. its a quintessential house wife/mother voice with 10 kids. i think of lynette scavo from desperate housewives.@ and youre an apologist liberal. you tipped that off to all of us here. whats new? moving on.@ its almost as if guys just flock to women unlike women do to men and thus us women have our pick. most guys are ugly anyway, and unless the dude looks like jensen ackles, i could careless lol.@ this is what i thought too. ive known guys who say stuff like this to girls theyve dated.@ i was going to say this too. he got his poor fragile male ego hurt and thus made up a lie that he met someone else. ive met guys who actually do this when theyre mad or hurt.@ which makes no sense. a confident person knows what they want. a desperate person gives sex to be loved.   reminds me of gabby from the show desperate housewives. she says in one particular episode how carlos (her husband) watched 6 of her runway shows before she would even look at him. and right before their first date, she pretended to be sick to make him chase her. then she goes after that, he was my slaveeeee.@ wowwwww! and men always go women dont like nice guys. they always pick assholes  no its more like you pretend to be nice and show your true colors later on and we tell everyone the truth because 99% of men are little bitches. maybe if they showed their true colors early on we could flick off the pricks and find men who are fucking normal.@ ive always said men are into their own sex. the way they treat their guy friends is weirdly protective compared to how women treat their female friends.@ ive never understood the be a guy thing. im very vocal about how i hate sports for example. if a guy doesnt like that, then he can find someone who does. theres a difference between doing something or whatever because your partner likes it versed pretending to be all about it.  like if a girl likes the ballet and the guy doesnt but goes because she loves it, hes going because he loves her and respects her interests. its the same if he really wanted to go to a football game and was looking forward to it but had no one else to go with and invited her just for a fun night out even though he knows shes not into it, thats different.   ive never had a guy actually ask me to go to a sports game so i dont know how much this happens in real life. but i thinking doing stuff with your partner to support them is very different than pretending to like it. in a relationship you should find gender neutral things to enjoy like concerts, movies, travel, food, etc. if you dont have gender neutral things in common, itll never work.@ and the girls boyfriend is no chris evans. he usually looks like jack black thinking he can have an opinion.  like dude, youre short and fat because all you do is drink and you think your opinion matters?@ because most men are secretly gay. ive said it many many times. the way guys act with their friends and are protective over them is how guys should treat their girlfriends~ but they dont.@ most men are ugly, thats the funniest part. go on any dating app and youll be swiping forever til a cute guy finally pops up after 500 swipes. these short, chubby men with ugly faces holding a fish in their photo are the ones that want women to act like their home boys? its hilarious that they think they can have standards. they dont have a leg to stand on with their own looks.@ ive always said and i swear that most men are gay/bisexual. i literally have told people this. men get super obsessed with their male friends, and they get obsessed with them in a way i never see women get with their female friends.   i think guys are in fact gay. its too eerie with the things they like and the strange bonds they have with other men. ever notice that? i have.   if sam and dean winchester werent brothers in the show supernatural, i would say they were gay/bisexual too as an analogy with their obsession with eachother. its behavior like that.@ i think men need to take a pill every month to lower their libido/hormones. bet it would save the world a lot of problems.@ agreed. men dont have the slightest clue as to what they like.@ is there a male version of this that women marry? like what we know our future husband should look like?@ omg we said the same thing! hilarious! i didnt even read this comment at first.@ dude i had a guy on a dating app who said i was so naturally pretty. i was wearing makeup for someones wedding and hair extensions. lmfao!  my sister always said that guys love makeup, but when they think of makeup they think giant red lips and blue eyeshadow. so when they see a girl wear nude makeup, they think its natural, smh. my makeup is more of my skins pigment. guys are dumb.@ theyre doing it to piss people off. nothing more.@ agreed. ive blocked him.@ thank you! and ive blocked him! i will read that.@ ive since blocked him! thank you!@ yup! he did the whole awww really? are you serious, haha. cmon!. he wasnt sexually harassing or lewd to me which is why i came on here. but now ive since blocked him on my phone and tinder.@ i did. i blocked him on my phone and on tinder. thank you!@ it was a first for me. i told him no and he wasnt like oh okay. he did the whole awww are you serious? haha. really? like he wouldnt lay off it til i just say straight up no, dude. then he stopped and talked about other things. thinking back i realized he was asking for reassurance about stupid childish things. we talked about people in our dms and joked about some stuff. i said how some guys match and never message you while others do but give one word answers. he literally asked me if he does that, which make me think to myself wtf?.  ive since blocked him on my phone and tinder.@ i did block him, both my phone and on tinder.@ thanks! and yes ive had guys neg me. its trashy. i cant imagine backhanding a compliment towards anyone.   after reading comments i think its that he immediately asked about my personal life and wanted to facetime. i had just moved to the area and while i talked about where i was from, he would listen and go off topic. he also kept asking for reassurance. we talked about people in our dms on dating apps~ and i mentioned how some guys give one word answers or match and never message you. he then had the audacity to go did i do that? thats when i raised my eyebrow (to myself) and said out loud uh, no. youre the one who messaged me. like i knew what he was doing but i didnt know how to get around such a childish question. he hung up the phone to go to sleep about 5-10 minutes later, thankfully.   i have since blocked him and unmatched with him on tinder.@ i think thats what ill do.   yeah i did realize i was trying to talk to him about things and he would interrupt me and ask a question about something that i didnt want to talk about. also the way he wanted to know my personal life gave me the creeps i think. it wasnt dirty or anything~.. it just felt the way a friend would ask, and hes not my friend. i cant explain it.\n",
      "with age, i am much nicer than i used to be to begin with.  however, a non-linear penalty function has arisen where i can go from \"excuse me?\" to \"fu asshole\" very quickly!  sounds as if

involved with someone younger.  my long wide-gap agr required a good deal of being talked to and convinced about before i would agree.  it was a good thing, that we both kind of screwed up.  i would do it again.  in fact, given the not-surprising low energy state of most people in my own cohort, it looks like a good idea.  i couldn't keep up with my grandfather until he was in his 80s, and it

or jealous or whatever.  nothing to get worked up about - can't fight or feed the trolls.@ it's a problem with relationships.  friendships.  regardless of the age.   my good friends, the best, are dead now.    there's actually an advantage to a big age gap (this was part of the \"it's ok that i am 30 years younger\" talk) - you get a house husband for a big chunk, and then are still young enough to find another guy in your 50s or early 60s.  i had all this presented to me to overcome my resistance.  it's sort of sensible.@ everybody has secrets.  she started with junk food.  then i found cigarettes.  it got to be cigarettes and alcohol.  then she added pot.  long after the washing her off in the tub, getting the vomit off.  after searching and finding her miles away.  after the first tears, after it all, when i cleaned out the house, i was still finding the secret stashes.  the chocolate was excellent!@ i would trade a good cat and 100000000000000 internet points and whatever for that wife!!!@ i kept a martin guitar \"america's guitar\" shipping box for years because of the \"made in mexico\" printed right below that!@ highly variable.  my friend has pictures of her dad.  he clearly doted on her and was a magnificent father.  unable to run with her.  pretty soon ill with a long illness.  not dwelling on his past, doing what he could.  too soon gone.  he was 62 when she was born, and lived an incredible gifted life of flight and combat, reflection and retreat into a monastic celibate life, then a rebirth.  but she missed that.  she had the tail end.  i suspect she isn't with me in part because of that lesson.    so there are big compromises.  i would possibly do it.  of two minds.  but i am always of two minds about everything!!@ that's what i thought.  imposing the concept of morals on a survey doesn't seem that moral!@ you might find me interesting.  i am certainly older.@ why i suddenly had a half-sister show up a few years ago.  surprise!@ that's pretty much what happened with my partner and i.  she finally got a real job, real career, and i pretty much retired.  big mismatch.  kind of job played into it.  the different life stage thing.  i don't see a way to avoid that without substantial negotiation and compromise, but some people can live with substantial negotiation and compromise.  most can't.@ well of course.  if someone 25 is with someone 65, then add 30 years and thats 55 - 95.  then add 10 years and that's 65 - 105   somewhere in there someone dies!!!@ i did that.  i brought her home drunk and unconscious.  she wasn't my date, though!!!  her mom was so nice.  maybe not the first time.@ exactly.  i was / am an excellent shot on paper.  last time i took a course i shot better than all the \"gun nuts\" in attendance.  equal to the instructor. lots of training etc. and likely some natural ability.  on paper.  still targets in good conditions.  as soon as the light isn't as good or i'm shooting from a barricade etc, anything different, and my ability to place a pistol shot well drops off very rapidly with range.    long guns aren't magic, and a few shows actually show realistic long gun use and accuracy.    none really capture the riveting excitement of a rifle round passing close overhead!@ if i am relaxed, i have a good solid radio voice, something i don't hear when i talk.   several people over many years have spontaneously told me i have a good voice for radio.    i also notice that i can't tell where i'm from.  there's a good solid layer of faint merseyside that sneaks in sometimes, in spite of my attempts to erase it.  and some clear subtle britishisms from my mother.  a solid core of no-accent-detected midwest.  and a more than minor southern edge, especially when i'm tired.  it's neither pleasant nor unpleasant to me.  amusing, if anything, when i can detect the various elements.    in chicago (i will never be able to speak chicago - i can't even fake \"sausage.\") i am clearly not from these parts, and have been mistaken for a southerner.  in the real south, nobody mistakes me for a southerner.  most places i'm simply not from around here.@ acheulean handaxe, most likely.  my ex has the oldowan chopper.  it was a good field season.   in more recent stuff, i owned and restored a ca 1680 violin once.  pretty cool!@ winter@ nothing different - nobody expects it.  it would be a surprise.@ humans@ i don't know about always.  but the ease with which people hit targets is quite annoying.  20 ft, well, ok.  but hitting something at 50 ft under fire with a sloppy grip is way too common.    the effectiveness of cover.  cars aren't invincible.    notable accuracy or otherwise quite impressive sort of accuracy.  val kilmer rapid reload  in heat.     the whole retreat covering each other is pretty good.  cruise in collateral:     clint missing the can in unforgiven is pretty realistic, too.  he manages to come off looking very rusty at the whole gun business!@ \"you have really nice legs\"   i'm a guy.  from a girl.  a rather young girl, from where i sit (20s).  just this last week.  i'm also 66.@ all i can go on is what people tell me.  i have no future crystal ball.@ sure.  she can't have mine anyway.  for once, someone who is seriously unlikely to want kids, for various reasons.@ our neighborhood.  all the apartment buildings, covered parking, playgrounds are gone, just a ghost image in a field for many years, now occupied by new buildings for disa global operations command.  anyway, there's a parking lot now where the apartment i lived in was.  it's pretty weird.@ wrote the governor a nasty note about his case against a state institution.@ $600.  fiat spyder.  1974?????  orange.  wish i had it now!@ not sure of question.   she did the smile thing with giggles.  i did the smile and laugh thing.  then we went into the shed.@ my first violin.@ 1.  call the police and leave the phone call open 2. get her free and tell her to run like hell, usually yelling \"stop that\" give sufficient opening. 3. run like hell myself, unless the situation is defused.  and the people who suggest assault as a response to unspecified sexual harassment need to get their collective heads on straight.  can't just go attacking people.  good way to end up dead or in jail.@ live at offutt afb while the strategic air command (\"peace is our profession\" - for an explanation, watch \"dr. strangelove,\" a documentary on the kind of thinking that led to operation looking glass).   was it building 500?  anyway, command bunker.  hq for all kinds of nuke missiles.  and looking glass.  we likely had 20 nukes targeted on us.   this was an especially fun place during the cuban missile crisis.    poof.  i could have been gone, in spite of assuming the right position under my desk at school.@ kind of off the funny topic, but it is sort of funny.  why does this thing have a scope on it?  it's not a sniper rifle.  i have a large aperture on my hunting peep sight on my lever action.  fast target acquisition, visual field remains open for non-aiming eye, less to catch on brush.  lever action rifles simply do not seem designed or intended for long-range use that would justify the weight and delicacy of a scope.    still, a cool-looking retro-mod item.  nothing i would want (frankly, i'd be happy to never shoot a firearm again).  still, a cool thing!!@ she didn't stop.  it was later she found that octopus hentai stuff.  unusual girl!!!@ i will second this.  is barely manageable with medical intervention.    the worst was on a long kayak trip, in the middle of the jungle.  i am not really sure how that went.  i saw old spanish in armor and giant prehistoric birds.  didn't die.@ my daughter started at 2.  she is very special.  getting her to avoid that in public was the issue.@ depends on your budget        r4r@ it all seemed so natural.@ i didn't read a way to dismantle white supremacy.  it's painfully clear that the white men who established this country built up a capitalist system where a goodly portion of the capital was other human beings, owned by white men.  smith certainly is dead on point with targeting all forms of oppression.  but how?  what is the mechanism, when our very government is set up to preserve a caste system, an oppression, based on economic status, education level, and most importantly, race?  how do we do it?@ let's expand sex into all sexual contact.  i had no idea that being physically close to a friendly female would make all kinds of cool things happen to my body (i'm a guy).  that my pulse would go up so fast.  that the world would dissolve into just her eyes, liquid and warm and blue.  that she would be so . . . warm.  inviting.  how i could feel her pulse, her breathing against me.  most of all, that contact of skin on skin (lips on lips) would have an electric dissolving time stopping impact.  that a female butt would be so incredibly soft.  all these amazing things nobody told me about.  it was in the mid 1960s, no internet and we were 11.  so all this was pretty much a surprise.    then the summer of love etc.  how incredibly warm a mouth was on my penis.  how my pulse would rise and i would just dissolve into her delicious vulva, the intense flow of electric connectedness when she came.  and the focus on now only intimacy, closeness, the afterglow, merging with another.  that connectedness, flowing together, becoming one surging beast.  that was the biggest surprise.  something i didn't know.@ her parents have no idea.  there are some barriers there, and a bit of abuse and oddness.  so i'm not going to hurry that element!!!!!!!@ my family is used to having everything in complete order, trusts etc.  i am all too familiar with keeping things crisp and orderly in that respect.@ never heard of it!  will look it up.@ reddit, of course.@ i am highly financially secure.  i'm also busy enough with my new work, and independent enough, that doing lots of things separately isn't going to bother me.  it's just such a surprise.   and there's the family thing.  my dad seems to be ok, and clearly in a quiet way enjoys her figure.  her family?  i am older than her parents, and from a completely different world.@ need to negotiate.  perhaps write down your goals, needs, concerns.  organize.  however you do this kind of decisionmaking, then develop a proposal.  in writing, or deliver in person.  be organized, objective.@ well, it was on the arpanet, which is sort of the internet.  an email from my dad, although i don't believe the term \"email\" was used yet.  i had to log in and everything was printed on big old ibm paper.  likely one of the first home-access ports - borrowed from work.  dial up, of course.  1971, if i recall correctly.@ sympathies.  i have heard such things in the workplace, and tried to put a stop to the gossip and spite.  but it persists.  it's wrong.    please don't let it discourage you.  i have felt i'd never love again a couple of times, and things come along.    be well, good thoughts your direction.@ this.  my f friend is mid 20s, and has tremendous range of experience volunteering, traveling.  but now is settling in to finish college, boring.  in contrast, my mid-20s daughter never traveled in her 20s, slogged through school and is a nice boring school teacher.  very different.    if a guy pampers you and takes care of you and loves you, that is good.  if he talks too much about things, he might just be nervous.  is a bit of a mind bender to have some wonderful young woman looking at one with doe eyes.@ my son is still wearing me out at 21, i'm 66@ education changes thinking.  thinking drives who people want to see in office.  educated people are the bane of populist reactionary demagogues.@ but for different reasons.  upper levels for control and cash, seems likely, and lower levels because he says what they think out loud.  that's a model.    the way out might be to bring the educational level up with real courses in government and critical thinking.@ ex wives.   cancer.   a house.  ever look at what a house really costs?  you buy it where you can afford it, then have to drive an hour each way.  time and money and stress.  instead of doing something different and living in an rv.  oh, or you could live on the junky $3000 house boat, pay $300 a month at the marina, poach your internet, and have no house payments.  i used to visit one of these happy frugal lake dwelllers!@ you just need a big family.  one guy buys a boat, totally financed, in the spring.  you get a summer and fall without a payment before they repossess.  next spring, a different part of the family gets the boat.  it isn't going to be yours long (well, it never really is), so maintenance is pretty easy.@ family is the hardest door to open.  even if one is simply friends, how to explain an age gap?  i've simply said something along the lines of \"please note: my friend is younger.\"  but my family is receptive to such things.    hey, it's only a 15 year gap.  that's nothing.  seriously.  my ex was about twice that gap (younger f) and we bridged it (although being older than her mom was odd).  i did have to take my mother aside and have a wee chat about comments.  she knew i'd up and go if she pushed very hard.@ yes.  men up to 30 are not really functioning.  i wasn't.@ you need to shower more often - the mold is taking over.@ come on, biden will have tactical nukes.@ that wasn't what i was concerned about.  i'm more concerned about closet nazis turning me in to the fascists.@ i know them all - my parents have been here since 1971.  i seriously doubt any of the current ones can really defend their houses.  hope i am wrong.  but off this block, fewer and fewer i know.  actually, covid has me knowing more people than before, lots of walkers.  but it still isn't like the number i knew within a mile when i spent years in the countryside.@ i really can hit things with a firearm.  more with a rifle, but i do ok either hand, either eye, barricade etc with a pistol.  i've heard incoming rounds buzz overhead, too close, and turned a button on a chest into a target.  no illusions here.  no interest, either.  prefer everyone to go home and enjoy a beer with the missus.    the area i live in does get cased at times, cars tested to see whether they are locked.  that wouldn't pass in my former rural area, where everyone was nosey.  i mean, looked out for their neighbors.  and most of my neighbors were armed.  but here, this is pretty much lily white snowflake territory.  i'm the only person here with both an old pickup truck and a big motorcycle.  if you're suddenly looking for rich old people to steal from, this is nirvana.  except i don't believe this would be the house to mess with while i am here.  only issue is my dog is broken and doesn't hear well enough any more to really be an alarm!!!    so no particular known threat, but if i wanted to hit lily white snowflakes, this is a place to make a splash.  and my local travels have crossed blm marches, neo-nazi gatherings, etc.  i've been accosted by 45's blackshirts for exercising my right to watch things on public property (they don't like \"who the fuck are you and where is your badge i'm calling the police now\").  whole place is gradually heating up.  adding firearms to the mix (as i've seen) isn't going to go well.    i have a couple of insights into the center of mess, real people who actually get into contact with government dealings at a high level (including 45 himself) - and they are more worried than i am.  it's worse than the media portray.  got me thinking about it.    i suppose i should start the process of getting licensed in this state.  i really hate carrying.  gives me the willies.  but i need the option.@ i am not sure what counts as an age gap.  i was married to someone 10 years younger for 20 years.  there were difficulties in both directions, but none due to age or point in life.  i was in a relationship of one form or another with someone 32 years younger for 10 years.  we got along very well, but structural changes brought out some fundamental flaws and overstressed things tremendously.  we parted great friends, and cannot see that age had anything to do with that.  currently my best friend is 40 years younger, and we're both baffled by how happy we are being together (note that we are not lovers, just explorers).  there are a few age-related aspects that we laugh about.  mostly, we come from completely different us culture backgrounds, and are enjoying openly bouncing these differences around.  i have experience and enthusiasm in completely different areas than she does, with enough overlap to make conversation interesting.  the whole premise was completely open communication and exploration.  i would spend time with her talking if she were 10 years older than me, and not cute as a button.  my common sense says this is impossible, but the reality is that the age gap feels like an illusion, we are just people who enjoy each others' company.  some people are stuck in their age.  some aren't.@ i have a bug-out bag, off-road bicycle, and am reasonably well trained (if rusty) with firearms.  but i have an old father and much less mobile son to think of.  so i'm likely to stay put in a somewhat marginal house.  unlikely.  but travel.  i've already (last summer) cycled into a group of open-carry fakes within 3 miles of here, had to route around protests, been warned off by law enforcement, and other incidents that would have highly surprised me 10 years ago.    frankly, i really do not like carrying a firearm.  a distorting experience.  some of these things on tv, words posted, and the current divisive executive branch have me concerned.  my level of trust in media and government have never been so low, and that includes my viet nam era experience (complete with accidental tear gassing).    at least i can hit things with a firearm pretty well.@ i imagine so.  i've seen some of these open carry, flack jacket, \"para-military\" guys in person.  i found the whole display both dangerous and empty at the same time.  scooted away from there as quickly as i could.  from what i could see, they showed no particular degree of situational awareness and had none of that effortless comfort with their gear that one would like to see in a real unit.  spray-on badass only.@ i don't get the \"black friends\" thing.  i used to shoot a lot, and two of my friends / instructors were indeed rather liberal (especially for the south).    punching holes at a few feet is fine, but really doesn't pattern one to deal with real opponents.  i am far from convinced that those really needing training will find it.  there's a good deal of wishful thinking in the people i've known who punch holes for kicks.  a good deal of over-estimation of ability to hit things, too!@ i've always figured the guy openly carrying a weapon is the first one to drop, push come to shove.  all that gear and strutting around just screams \"me first!  shoot me first!'@ just having a gun doesn't really do much.  punching a hole in a target during qualifying at a short range with a 9 mm pistol does not prepare one to actually aim and fire at a human being.    that said, i've known a couple of surprisingly liberal shooters who were top at camp perry during their day, one of whom had a job that involved dropping humans at long range.  i kind of doubt our domestic terrorists do so well.@ so what can an independent do to be more secure in case of conflict?  i live in the dc metro area, in a white, upper-class neighborhood (where i don't very well fit).  i am within a very long frisbee throw of highly diverse neighborhood and shopping strip.  if you want to find people of color, it's right there.  which i happen to like.    do i make sure i am armed for light cqb?  just plan to defend again some unknown light force?  get my carry permit and start going armed again?  i am not at all certain what is rational given the wild swings of everything over the last year.    what if i host my poc friend here in times of trouble?  will my apparently rational neighbors turn me in to the elimination squads?    all this has me thinking crazy thoughts.@ it works fine, sometimes.  i have had several cuddle fwb.  have to be mature enough to handle any  urges that come up.  and clear boundaries.  i have slept pretty much unclothed cuddle up with a cuddle buddy without any sex happening.  a certain amount of giggling.@ be very specific and evocative of who you really are, post a few places, screen carefully.  look for a fit - even if a fit of differences.  go do things you like, and see what older guys show up.  if you cycle in the dc metro area, i am wishing you would stop and say hi!   so many really well rounded solo female riders look like real, solid women.  but me saying hi makes me a creep.    don't be shy, you might regret it.@ this must be a challenge.  this community has a single token poc.  i can feel the stares just when i exist (a fit white guy in his 60s) don't conform in dress (this is upper class yoga pants trophy wife retired white guys - rich newbies with very proper kids area), by having a pickup truck & motorcycle, and by walking around with the \"wrong\" female companions (too young, wrong class indicators).  my younger black friend simply will not walk with me during daylight here.  not at all.  i can't blame her.  so how does one fit in.@ it is a worry.  but it isn't unique to age gap.  my favorite person, who i wish were here, died (long time ago).  my age!!!   things happen.   the anxiety is so hard to deal with.  but all you have is today.  enjoy today.  nothing is certain, except that the only joy we have is in the moment, and the best joy is love.  plan for the future, but stay in the moment.   that's what i do.  i tell myself that the age issue isn't really the most important thing.    on a practical matter, age gap relationships leave the younger partner with a chance to find someone else at a reasonable age.  my long term past partner (10 years) explained this to me in the process of talking me into thinking it was ok.@ hi is likely to be nervous as well.  keep calm and carry on!    i have a new friend, and i get butterflies every time i get a text.  being giddy about each other is a good thing.    enjoy!@ yup.  i hadn't thought about the tsar b for years.  disturbing.  you put it in perspective.  kind of a surprise we didn't have more dangerous failures, and that we haven't dropped any more.  i was never sure what i could do about it, really.  but i spent years disassembling places that made the pieces.  worked on a facility to take apart the weapons.  cleaned up the poisonous debris, although that's a bit of a misnomer, since much can't really be \"cleaned,\" just isolated.    i feel personally the impact of that whole system every day.  as an elementary school child i walked to school, within eye sight of rows of black b52 bombers, armed and ready.  \"peace is our profession\" screamed at a me.  clockwork timed, a doomsday plane departed every 8 hours.   my therapist suggested this contributed to my cptsd.  perhaps the whole world suffers from ptsd over that period.@ also workers in the facilities.  friend of mine disabled, for example.  really was a bad thing to do.@ yes indeed.  at least we knew what we were doing.  well, sort of.   see unanticipated yield: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle_bravo  the dark shape in the column of water rising up is an aircraft carrier.  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k08cea3c4ay/vfzlv76icgi/aaaaaaaaay8/gor8jci5sdm/s1600/castle+bravo.jpg   i used to work with people who were there.  apparently it was very exciting.  another fun program we all thought was a good idea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-altitude_nuclear_explosion@ that is remarkable.  thank you.  at least the us and ussr - oops - russia have stable, sane leaders.@ of course, a substantial component of capitalism in what became the us is that of making people a big part of the capital.  the colonies and then us pretty much had people as chattel, with wives pretty much falling in that category, and a vast array of in-betweeners considered subjects to be commanded.  those attitudes quietly or not so quietly persisted.@ it's easy.  avoid people!!!    that and learning to say things like \"well, you may be right.\"  i tend to alternate that with \"bullshit.\"  a reflex.    still working on always being kind.  still working on.  still.@ well.  it's optional.  but pretty cool.  i waited to really get into it until my kids were grown!@ i will have to look that up.  there are classified things here that are quite disturbing as well.  many things i would rather not know!!!!!  along the \"what were they thinking?\" line!!!!!@ that, and not taking everything personally.  we will be buffeted by winds.  handling that with grace is important.  i come from the stiff-upper-lip school.  my mother always had such good humor.  i remember her leading me around her childhood roaming area, matter of fact walk.  here's where the unexploded bomb was, here's where the heinkel crashed, see where the corner of the school was rebuilt, here's where great aunt's house was when the anti-ship bomb flattened it.  never made me apprehensive, just seemed an adventure she handled with grace, to help her sister handle it.@ well. this wasn't in the actual school.  but a real girl and i actually made each other have orgasms.  11 year old me never expected that!@ among other things, we lose.  learn to lose gracefully.  not to give up, or not fight, but to lose things and let go.  friends move off, change.  things flow.  the obituary.  the warm dog, friend for a decade.  love.  let go.    as others point out, health and physical activity.  i can still outride most of the people i see on bicycles, can still backpack.  keep interested in being alive.  stradivari's great violins were mostly built when he was old, and developed through constant evolution lasting decades.    partner up with the young and energetic at heart, someone like that will keep you lively.  avoid the disparaging people.  the things people say about others behind their backs generally reflect who the speaker is.  learn to ride a motorcycle.@ bomb damage assessment reports for the nuclear weapons used in wwii.@ so many factors.  flood zone. i had a house, not in a flood zone.  new study, suddenly my house is in a flood zone.  how is one supposed to deal with that, where a designed human-controlled reservoir suddenly gets administratively reshaped?  how do we deal with the human-caused chaos of the mississippi floodplain?  dikes just move water downstream more quickly in a peakier wave, and make the crest higher.  we committed to them, people count on them, but they do harm.  get rid of all and let the river work properly?  i think so.  move the towns, the individual houses.  just let the flloodplains work.    will be interesting to see.@ that makes sense.  i'm not there!!@ that's great!   i have no idea where that is.  i don't even know what country this is!!  it's flat around here, but there's a 26th.  well, the locals think there are hills, but i've lived among hills.@ oh, i've been on that a lot.  takes an hour to ride to georgetown if i loaf!  but that is dull and not high.  there are trails right here, but it is so incredibly flat (as far as mountain peaks go).  i miss my homeland, and keep thinking about the amazing hikes in idaho along gravel roads!!!@ i have no idea how to ever arrange such things.  not knowing anyone in what are to me, remote lands.  seems as if it would be a lifetime high-level adventure to travel in foreign lands by bicycle off the roads, to remote places!  lovely.@ this is very inspiring.  how do i get there?!?@ this is one gaudy bike.  i want one!!!  nice job!!!!@ this is spectacular.  i really want to do this type of thing.  it's just that driving my bicycle somewhere to ride seems kind of bizarre!  i'll have to start doing it.  inspiration!@ your headline caught my attention.  here i am!, not really, far away, but it turns out i'm a surprising % viking - likely from the irish and cheshire ancestry, lots of viking invaders and settlers.    i'm sure there are plenty of fine young viking descendants out there to select among!@ well.  the overt principles.  trump appears to believe in the covert principles underlying our persistent color-based caste system, our refusal to move into being a modern country (e.g., universal health and pension), and trump is in line with our too-frequent \"me first\" approach to things!  all unfortunate.@ i suggest you read g washington's farewell address.  his three points are that we must remember unity - that country as a whole needs support over and above separate divisions, that the party system wasn't needed and would lead to insurrection and destruction, and to avoid foreign entanglements.  he is still correct (and he used to own the land i am typing this on - pretty cool!)\n",
      "dont care~. fuck em@ black at it again@ lol fuck mayates~. i dont care if one out of 1 million feel bad@ its honestly a non issue. i allowed myself to let loose and enjoy doing coke with some girls who are into it. the reason for it being a binge is because nobody sells small ammounts of coke during covid lol. so we just finished the left overs over a few weekends   coke is overrated and i can see how it can become a habit. hence why i dont want to touch it unless its maybe nye or my birthday. doing coke one to a few times a year isnt that bad. booze is more damaging than coke.  the addiction rate for heroin is 12 percent. which is more addictive than coke. some people can enjoy coke a few times a year w no issues. i just dint want to flush away a few hundred down the toilet.@ thanks man! yeah i had a 5-6 time use over a month but i think coke is overrated. i rather have drinks on the weekend.   dating sometimes can make mental health worse. not all people are nice and considerate lut there@ everything seems worse on reddit. ive done coke maybe 5-6 times in my lifetime. and as far as hairloss its not noticeable at all. but im depressed at what is to come.@ im a hispanic male~ i have only once gone out with a white girl from tinder after many years. i match with a decent share of white girls but none reslly capture my attention and i believe are harder to get a response from.  luckily there is a fair share of latinas who want to meet.@ i wish i could give you more up votes. i had a date in which as surprisingly as it may sound i was not expecting or really wanting sex.  the night went really well. on my end i paid for dinner, drinks, showed her some cool spots in the city and we had great convo.  by the end of the night she started to legitimately jump on me at the restaurant and make out with me in public. by the time we got in the car i gave in and tried my best to perform sexually when i was not feeling it. the girl basically told me if we dint have sex she wanted to go home (presumably to find someone else to entertain her) we ended up hooking up but it was not my greatest performance maybe a bit average. we talked the next day briefly and over the months i tried asking her out to dinner. it never happened again abd she just deleted me after a few months.    i am not trying to be judgemental but she was maybe a 5-6.5 at best. i just have a thing for girls with some of her features. she felt and maybe acted like she was more attractive because she gives it up easily and has some attractive men after her.   this is online dating sometimes lol.@ meant to say chest is slightly tired i can feel my heart muscle slightly sore. but nothing insane.@ you may be addicted brother@ you great man~. i mean you look really good. this gives me hope and also glad to know there is someone a short drive who can do the transplant.@ you must be from the boston area? i think i called that office lol. small world@ looks great.. where did you get it and how much? are you on finasteride?@ i was really excited about a particular person and really excited. but then they just kinda ghosted me as things seemed to be going so good. i feel like im nervous to even date now lol. i just dont want more let downs like these.@ im sorry for the loss of your pet. someone torturing an animal is also concerning because it is a sign that they are crazy there is a better term but i cant think of it right now. sometimes killers start with animals and progress to humans.@ try smp and get jacked. there is this bald dude who comes to my job and this girl always comments how sexy he is.  bald, muscular and tatted@ yes, the girl he made cry due to the n word was considering action.   a few years back his nephew worked in our department he was his and my manager. it was known to everyone at the job that his nephew was shooting up heroin and using other drugs on the job.  it was obvious as the dude was nodding out and clearly high. all the employees at the factory would comment and some even would commen its pay day we know what ~. is going to do today drugs at work  that same guy got paid more than us and got favorable skill training. the excuse was that he was more experienced.   the boss would also overlook his blatantly obvious drug usage and cover for him and his mistakes but call me names for anything small that i may have done.   this guy is a pure asshole of a boss.@ thank you for your comment. this is a great piece of advice. not enough people know their rights.@ i mean you think its cool to say that to someones face? blatant disrespect. i would appreciate it if he approached me in a constructive manner. it seems as you are blaming me here. im resonably pissed at someone saying that to me infront of the entire department.    i relfected and took ownership for my part.  but as hr said its his job to give clear instructions. they even recognized it was not all my fault.   but my point is wether i made a mistake or not there is no excuse for another person to talk to you that way. especially your boss who should be more professional.  the mistake was fully fixed within 2 minutes. i could have fixed it myself as well. it was nothing major. he just has a tendency to overreact to stress. most people in the job try to avoid telling him anything and just resolving it before it gets to him,   he was playing fantasy football the entire time i was past my shift looking for instructions and help. so fuck him.@ it does suck.. i want to leave soon but id like for hr to really put him in his place. a few weeks ago he made a girl cry by saying nigger and spook outloud.   we are tired of his religious and political rants too.   my co worker whom i know from childhood even admits that they treat me like shit here. if anyone else makes such a minor mistake its over looked. since he seems to dislike personally there is a bias against me in which he reacts more strongly and unfair towards me compared to others.   i have no idea abour rights. but i been too afraid to report it because i have no idea how to win a case against him unless its on video or something. he is smart enough to make arguments that would get him out of trouble.  he has been in legal trouble with co workers over this behavior at a previous job. he lost a court case.@ i took ownership for the entire thing because i just felt bad. and he has a long history of calling me names and abusive behavior behind my back. i get nervous to do anything that is remotely a mistake even if its minor because of how he talks behind my back.    i actually called him for guidance the night of the incident and did as he told me. he spent a few mins talking about fantasy football to his friend while i was already past my shift. i was frustrated.. this is how the confusion happened.  i followed his instructions and seeing as he was now covering the line i resonably assumed he would do the other duties of shuting down the line. he dint and said it was on me.  its hard to explain without knowing the job. but thats basically it in a nutshell.  im just outraged at how he said that to my face infront of everyone. thats pretty abusive and uncalled for. my co worker was shocked.@ there is no excuse for a boss to talk to an employee that way.   i owned up for part of my mistake but it was not all my fault.   the same boss who spoke to me in that manner was the guy who i called to the production line. i was 10 minutes past my shift looking for guidance on what to do. often times things change at my job without notice and its one of our main frustrations.   for example they decide they need overtime 30 minutes before the end of the day and then we feel obligated to stay since nobody else can cover. ans then 15 minutes later they cancel.   i was frustrated because i asked him for guidance and instead he came out to talk about fantasy football to another manager on the line. at that point i was ready to leave in frustration. i walked away and returned. i followed his instructions and clocked out. the next day we had issues.  hr told me it was my managers job to give clear instructions and guidance and that it was not up to me to go around trying to figuere out what was there to be done. that is my managers role.@ this was kinda the start of the night lol.@ my teacher has an only fans. lol@ to not get coke dick i dint know sorry@ i feel fine just a bit hot. no chest pains or anything. i wont do it again brah@ loser~. you gotta skii with other people bro~ anyway add me my username is@ i was not aware of hairloss until i went on here. i always thought balding was a recession on the hairline. theni learned about diffuse thinning and to my horror ive had it for a while now.  nobody can tell im losing hair. im guessing hairloss starts years before most people can even notice it on themselves. those who are hyper aware can notice much earlier.@ thanks brother! do you find yourself to be chatty even after the high is over?@ i never took free cocaine lol. im always buying for everyone and i thought coke was like 300 a gram before i knew about the drug. 80-100 a gram is pretty cheap. especially since its not supposed to be a daily thing.   i just dont think its all that grea. its fun for sure but proceed with caution.@ why do some people get really offended? ive done coke like 5 times and its not a habit or issue lol. some people just dont enjoy it as much.@ i agree with taking it slow with coke. have a few drinks snort a few lines and chill. it sounds amazing right now lol hopefully im not becoming addicted but i am stopping for a while or for good.   im addicted to sex so that convo would probably be rough on me. snorted coke with a hot chick recently and i was like wow this is great.@ i take viagra recreationally~ fatty foods just make the drug longer to take effect and it may lower its effectiveness. if you eat it on an empty stomach you will get the effect earlier. i still eat but if im eating fatty foods ill take it a bit earlier like an hour before hooking up to ensure its kicking in on time.   pretty much use it to avoid whiskey dick.@ im talking about snorting coke. shooting up is def on another level. i made a recent thread on r/drugs and most people said it was overrated. i dint even frame the question asking if it was. most coke users also have been saying similar things. cheaper drugs out there create better highs according to them.  my take oh my limited experience is that it is overrated but easy to become a habitual user if you arent careful. even if its not the funnest thing ever its still fun. it tricks your brain into wanting more the more you use it.  fishscale coke could be on a different level but depending on where you are its hard to find. most dealers ive seen have stuff thats not great or terrible sorta a middle of the road coke.@ it isnt but this forum is more pro cocaine. check r/drugs its overrated@ its the fact that i made plans with them and set reservations. now im left scrambling looking for something to do. it sucks. i rather not have time wastes@ nah every chick i know is anti coke. i got 1gram left may just give it to my friend@ as in its fun but not as fun as a non experienced user may expect. cocaine is hyped up in movies. its still good but some peoplle may be dissapointed.   eitherway its not worth all the negatives brother.@ why cabron?@ thanks fam~ i really appreciate your comment.  1g was too much and the adderall and booze ontop of it was a bad idea.   thanks again@ this just shows how fake instagram is and how much it is about attention in a nut shell. pretty hypocritical to post about body image yet she photoshops some of her negative attributes lmao@ thanks even this little comment has made me feel better.@ exactly some men thin bald more than others. it sucks but atleast hoping it happens later in life than at a young age. getting more women than ever before now@ whats your experience with coke?@ im concerned about a loved one. he said he was using it every week but then said he dint want too anymore but also said he do some with me lol. im just concerned they are addicts and lying.@ why does it mess up your face?  also how easy is it to get addicted? i know someone who says they started doing it every weekend but then quit and dont ever want to do it again. not sure if thats bs though@ ive done it twice and never thought i was high but now i know i was lol. coke is def more subtle than i thought. but its energetic, talkative, and confident feel. i get that from booze alone so dint think it was the coke. but after drinking without coke i was like fuck~ i want some coke its much funner to be drunk while on coke.@ sometimes its cops trying to bust ppl online lol. seems like a waste of time. im sure the postal service has ways to look for drugs@ right but still fear the cops would bust it. but pemme know the place. do i need to use the darkweb or something for this@ i mean~ i donr want my house raided by the cops or dea. i also dont trust that stuff from online isnt cut with fetanyl. it just seems risk@ im on the same stuff except i opted not to microdose shrooms or psychadelics until next time. i wanna enjoy coke on its own.   im too paranoid of becoming an addict. so i may do it one more time with a friend.5g for both and just lay off forever or a long time. not what i expected. but the adderall at end did nada lol.@ why watch out as its cut with dangerous stuff?@ why you mad? neanderthals dint get pegged@ why are you gae?@ lol whats next having your gf fucked by another man is also cool as long as you give her permission?@ still gay still dont care. go get pegged you cuck@ its gay~ gay men have sex by taking it up the ass. you are inserting a fake penis up your ass. i dont care how good it feels. drugs feel good but i dont shoot up heroin.@ called being a fag@ men should be pegged unless they are gay men. its too submissive for a straight dominant partner.@ where is your pride in being a man when you are getting pegged?@ get rid of this parasite foo. she doesnt love you hawmie. once she sees your new job she will try to leach on. you deserve better. leave her and have some fun.@ whats your adderall experience and how are they different? supposedly its to get higher quicker. my friend snorts half and swallows half.@ youe dealer doesnt have addies? they are super easy to get. heard you may become super focused tho on whatever task you are doing. these are prescribed for adhd.@ i did some manual stimulation and she was able to finish before i stared penetration. is this type of sex disliked by women? maybe i should use less streght and more speed and rhythm.@ no idea why the mods thought i was bragging. i am legitimately looking for advice as im pretty oblivious to this stuff.@ are you guys doing this or just going with what you got@ i wanna do coke but i think ill love it so much. i always thought stimulants are my thing. hell i drink coffee once a year and i get high on starbucks and just go off the walls with energy and euphoria@ except for viagra only blood to your penis.@ i wish i could upvote you more. because what you said seems to be true. i have a loved one who had a falling out with me. during our time away she tried coke a few times according to her and her underlying heart conditions and liver conditions have now come to the surface.@ im assuming the endo dint mind fin and was not concerned?@ i will be hopefully speaking with that person sometime. i think they have a causal view on coke and they think they cant become addicted. aslong as they are around that company it will be in their life.  cocaine does not impair your enough even when sober to not know its wrong though.  my argument still stands~ you would not give a loved one coke if you truly cared about their well being. loving someone is also taking care of them. infact this persons underlying health issues flared up probably due to coke.@ you seem to be offended. i recognize its both who are responsible. but i would not give someone who doesnt use coke at all.  i was in a position to give coke to a girl who never tried it before. its morally wrong to expose someone to it. its even more wrong for an addicted person to give it to someone who is clean.  like hey i love you coke has gotten me areested and fucked up my life but wanna do some?@ i mean giving someone coke and considering you are addicted to it and are having issues cleaning up should atleast make you consider the other persons potential for addiction.  people casually give out coke without even thinking that you could get the other person addicted.   if i truly love a girl and i had coke issues i would advise her to stay away and never give her any. just as i would with any loved one. coke is highly addictive@ transplant? ive looked him up he and dr pak are the real deal and the best when it comes to treating baldness.@ i never said i was against fin its my hope. one has to admit its a hard situation to make sometimes@ i would lol. ive dealt with sleezy doctors here who wanna sell me laser caps and prp ans they are considered the best. atleast i can trust him and vacation there.@ hey i love my thick and beautiful black hair. i realizs most men will lose it with age as one wrinkles. im fine if i can keep density until its not considered uncommon to be thinning. even if i had his hair at 49 i would get a transplant to fill in some bald spots and bad id have great hair for a man of that age. i just dont wanna be full nw7 or diffused with wispy hairs.@ wrassman on here does a haircheck test and its pretty accurate. hes an expert on this stuff i was gonna see him but covid is fucking it up@ same! my dad was 47 and had what one could consider normal hairloss for a man his age. im not sure if it stopped. he just starting buzzing it pretty much to a bald head just with a hairline. he basically looks like when you get smp at 49.@ are you fully bald how bad is your hairloss mate?  have you done treatment?@ same here i keep rubbing my head to see how many hairs fall. keep looking at my calp under bright lifths. keep taking pictures i been in so much anxiety that i missed signing up for college. i never thought id go bald. infact i did dna by ancestry and plugged my genes into this site  which said i was 12x less likely to go bald.   my grandfather was norwood 1.5 with full density in his 80s then my dad and every male relative of his is bald. why could they not just get their dads hair genes and pass them on@ baldness should not be a death sentence bro.  i dont think ill be bald until my 30s but i totally have thinning. i can also rock the buzzcut since my hairline will likely stay. im hispanic and would a tan i can maybe pull it off. lots of latinos in southern cali are bald by choice but i may get confused for a cholo.  i can also take fin and hopefully maintain and regrow rill atleast my 40s. sexual sides are what worry me.@ you think youd get to nw7? if it stops at nw3 you are actually quite lucky a nice transplant can fix you up. and if thats your final balding pattern you good@ but not always some dudes look hot bald. scalp micro pigmentation can also do wonders.  even if i was one of those dudes id still love having hair more. may just take finasteride hopefully i can get like 2 years from it@ lol i broke up with someone who i was planning on marying and then as soon as i did i learned i was thinning. life is a bitch@ out of 20k ppl in one study it would make sense to atleast see it@ what did they say about using fin?@ this is why taking fin is so concerning for me. i wish fin dint have the potential for these crazy sides. i love sex and sexual performance and dominance has been a deciding factor in keeping certain women interested. (the type who just want hookups) it also helped beat other guys when competing for the same girl to date.  lately, my libido has been down my erections have been softer and i cant perform in bed as well as i used to due to sometime off. this is not caused by meds its caused by overstimulation.   i wish fin lasted forever and dint have sides@ i love how that page is growing. it was a page for hispanic foos but now they got everyone on there.@ foosgonewild@ balding will suck at any age. atleast at that age a guy most likely will be married and his wife will still love him and be attracted.   in your 20s,30s balding really affects your dating life. i think at the age of 50 most peoples looks have started to fade as well as their health.@ nah, hondurans have a better team. i have seen them in a world cup more than once in my lifetime while es has not made it since the 80s. they constantly make it further in the gold cup as well.@ called diffuse thinning@ people should stop discounting you. there was some dude on here years back who has tsken it for 20 years and has the same white thing and minor gyno.  seems like you may be developing gyno.@ it can for some guys. minox and dermarolling may not cause enough of a difference. minox is also annoying as you have to apply twice daily and its greasy. it also doesnt stop hairloss it gives you temporary gains.  propecia is the only thing that works well when it does. some guys have been able to maintain for 20 years.   balding can really affect your mental health and im turn your physical health.@ it must be so difficult. for me i am always looking at how much scalp is showing. we can take propecia but it can really give you sexual side effects and infertility. sometimes its not reversible. its really scary@ im 27 probably been balding since 25-24 never noticed since i always grow my hair and its thick. i feel as tho a stressful relationship triggered it.@ seems like balding is a european thing mostly. but also black men seem to have a good ammount of balding.    native americans dont bald unless mixed blooded.@ im wondering if people who start losing hair in 20s will have it worse than if older. or if it could stop in your 20s and pretty much maintain.@ i just thought it was because i cut my hair shorter bright lights and how i mess with my hair.@ afraid of shed and side effects.@ you may be better in the end as much as this cut deep. i totally simpathize with you dude.  even if she was single, hooking up with a married dude shows low morals and i would not be surprised if she was doing something shady even when dating you.   if she cared she would have called or done something. she does not care man. just as mine does not care. she cares for the memories and what we had and who i am.but she does not care about being together.  it sucks and it burns~ i get the pain. i had days where i wanted to die.   you dont need her. she sucks and you deserve real love. its hard to rationalize since our brains want that person.@ my regret was not being there as much when things started to fall apart. i have myself to blame for a good part of the breakup. i have grown so much from the breakup and recent life events. i know to do better.  in your case its not your fault man. if you were a good dude and she is hooking up with married dudes she sounds like a cheater and a bad person.  you deserve way better. even if she came back you should be like no thanks.@ you sound exactly like me. it was 3 years and she was willing to marry me. she walked away and began dating a new guy quite quick.   we talked for 4 hours with an hour break since she had a phone meeting.   i just vented a bit about how she did me wrong. we just then talked like friends for a while about memories and stuff.   i really thought those memories would bring some feelings for her but instead they brought them back for me.    we will meet next week so i can return something of value. i just miss her and dont want to be with anyone else. biggest regret in life.@ thats good. trolling is nice. im a psychopath it keeps me out of trouble in real life@ haha you are legit retarted if you dont see that by the most part these postings are made to create a fake trolling online persona. it makes people more mad and fall for my hate comments. it seems to have worked since you are on my dick and going through all the postings it gives me great joy.  i mean salvadorans have the privilege of having the great meso american civilizations in their land.  that is above anything hatians have.  lol you are coming at me like hatians are tall? legit it sucks to be hatian and black.   you dont get it. i have stated so many times how much it sucks ti be hatian and blaco that notning you say will make me change my mind or think that somehow being a hatian is better thats how racist i am towards you guys and how low i see you as a people.@ atleast you beat cancer bruh@ lol a haitian is talking about poor neighborhoods? look at all the ghetto ass hatians in miami.   there are treatments for hairloss. meds and transplants but nothing for being a hatian.  you cant tell me what is there to be proud off?  haiti poorest country in the west, haiti with a low ass literacy rate, haiti with a high rate of infections.  you have like no infrastructure, no money, over 30 coups since the french decided to give up on you.  losing hair or being hatian is an easy question.    bruh, hatians are eating mud and are poorer and black. you never told me what that shit hole has to be proud off? other than freeing themselves from france boy did haiti begin to suck when hatians took over.  haiti sucks~ not even dominicans want you. haiti is so poor it makes el salvador look wealthy.   answer my question. why would you be proud of that craphole with your ugly ass creole language and your dumb names like jean.@ lol okay spook go back to practicing voodoo and eating sand cookies. they legit eat mud in haiti.   atleast there is ancient civilizations and things to do in el salvador. haiti is an all around shit hole with blacks. labadee is your only nice place and it sucks.    niggers cant run a country every nig country is a failed state. we should take all the hatians send them to africa, sanitize haiti and start over.   i think being hatian is worse than losing hair. legit the dirtiest ugliest mfers are from haiti. your culture sucks, your food is shit, you are wanna be french niggers.   can you tell me why someone should he proud of being hatian? im being serious~. haiti is way poorer than any spanish speaking country.  haiti sucks~ go jerk off to wyclef jean.   usa should use haiti to test bombs.@ better than being a nigger from haiti. i would literally die than be a spoook. you know haiti is bad when el salvador looks way better compared to haiti.    we need another earthquake in haiti. or dominicans to finish the hatians off.    please dont ever try to tell me or argue with me that haiti in anyway is better than any country in latin america. haiti belongs in africa. black lives dont matter die nig.@ no@ im actually trying not to be a racist anymore especially towards hatians. they just got dealt a bad hand not their fault.@ you got so mad that you went to look at my other trolling post. shit are hatians that stupid. its part of building my profile so others can see my postings and attack me on who they think i am lmao. im in reality a white supremacist from indiana.    i dont need to know about haiti. it sucks its a failed state. i dont care about your government. you are so proud of being inferior. you never answered what haiti has to be proud off in the modern era. other than freeing themselves from france which made then worse off in the end.  dude haiti sucks another earthquake would be good to wipe your island away.@ no comeback to what i said about haiti. would not fuck a haitian if it was free or paid for.  so many hatian hookers in miami maybe your mom should suck my white dick for papers.   go cry about george floyds death and talk about how you beat the shit out of dominicans. yet you coons flock over to the dr all the time.    haiti sucks. why would anyone be proud to be a failed state? tell me?@ white power buddy@ you forgot one key word you are hatian so you are the lowest of the low.  basically africa in the americas   your food sucks, your culture sucks, your country has nothing to offer, your language is a nigger version of french, you are dying to make it to miami, your people are dirty, you dont have running water, your crime rate is crazy, you are ghetto in the united states,  damn i wish i was hatian. did i forget constant earthquakes@ niggers@ sorry cant hear you past my trolling.    haiti sucks even dominicans hate you@ yall eat mud cookies in haiti@ trump 2020 haiti sucks@ dam i hope you arent white like me. we should make them slaves again. haiti was cool when us french ruled it. then we left and the blacks ruined our most wealthy colony.@ i would never go to haiti lmao. its a sh1t hole country like trump says. why would i wanna go there?@ i never said that blacks cant be french. blacks are ethnically african. my point is about hatians who have never been to france have no french connections other than what influence may be in hatian culture from colonial times who claim to be french. its like a mexican claiming to be spanish they arent.  its like they are quick to claim french before their african ancestry in order to be exotic. then again who cares haiti is a country nobody really cares about except for haitians.@ shut it social justice warrior. haiti stinks@ i never sais blacks arent supposed to speak french. im saying that many blacks claim to be french when they are blacker than any africani have seen. its like me being 2 percent irish and claiming to be irish lol.@ thank you.. we did agree to use the pill. i dint want to go further after it broke. but she mentioned that she would take the pill. i was using condoms and was pretty mad when it broke.@ lmfaoooooooooo bro~ thats a good one.@ well yes i had already camed in her and she got ontop and i said if you take the pill.   either way, get of your high horse. you literally sound like a karen. like the mom who wants to speak to the manager right away.@ we realized it broke when we were done.@ you sound like an incel@ yeah like people havent been having sex for years after meeting at a bar or a party. is hooking up a new concept to you? a condom was used. the issue is that unfortunately it failed.@ of course but its also insane to not take plan b after a guy cums inside of you from a broken condom after you just met 4 hours earlier.  it makes me so mad that someone would be this wreckless. why risk bringing a life into the world when you dont even know each other and i would not want to do anything with her because of her actions.  it would be selfish not to take plan b just to keep or trap a guy you literally dont know thats so selfish.@ magnum bareskin bro! by trojan. try em out and see how much funner sex is.@ they are pretty good. the first time i used them i was like wow. of course no condom feels the best but bareskin is close enough without all the risks.@ bareskin condoms are pretty close to sex bareskin hence the name.@ looks younger than 37@ porque muchos vivimos en estados unidos o llegamos a estados unidos de pequeos. tambien hay muchos estadounidenses de sangre salvadorea aqui.@ we have too! salvadorans get looked down upon even if its silently.@ my point is that its not our fault. the average salvadoran should not be faulted by the actions of our poor governments who have exploited and stolen from us for generations.  we can own up to it but also recognize that we are pretty powerless when your vote will go to a corrupt government no matter who is in the ballot.  we can own up to it but they are victim blaming. the ones who truly should own up are the elite but they live in a different el salvador a much nicer one at the cost and reputation of their countrymen and country.@ toxic incel like mindset. attractive is suggestive but ask a woman if she wants to long term date a shit person. seen plenty of not conventionally attractive guys with good looking women.   they have to be attracted to you in some way but saying they dont care about respect and are only focused on looks is a pretty crappy outlook on women.@ they are wasting the guys time. i feel like people dont have consideration for others. i try to be polite and have decency towards people in the dating world.@ pretty louse to make it at others expense and to waste their time. 15 girls have all failed to produce a date its honestly annoying.@ this is confusing to me. why would you add a guy from a dating site and promise to go out just for fun.@ one of the very few smart comments on this thread. thank you. i agree this is toxic for young men to see.@ its peoples attitudes blaming they cant get laid cause they are short. thats toxic@ you have short man syndrome@ perfect example of a toxic personality. i was being nice and you still manage to be an ass.  maybe some of you guys are single because of your toxic personality not your height.@ lol dont have to say it twice. i just hope you guys change your attitudes. shortness sucks no lie about it. but there is still hope and tons of short girls.@ so, being 58 i was never too insecure about height but always was jelous of much taller people because they get more respect as in they appear to be more physically dominant.   i became insecure when my 54 ex kept saying i was short. her brother is 6ft and dad is like 510. her sister is 57 and her husband 62    after we broke up she started to date a guy who is 510 just a tad bit taller then me. she made so many references on how she loved that he was tall and her familly did too.  she even said if i was taller i probably would not talk to her as id be way out of her league.  i feel for shorter guys too.@ the rock, shaq, black dudes can pull off bald.@ it is said that native americans  dont have the mpb gene. look at old pictures of native americans they all have full and thick hair into their old age. its not an issue for them.@ if only we were super attractive in the top 20 percent we would have an easier time.@ i only stick on tinder because its my only avenue for meeting girls. i work in a factory with older people and go to school online. im not good at picking girls up in school or the gym. i also think the gym is not a dating spot and my gym is a very serious powerlifting gym which frowns upon that anyway.    im just sick if matching and it leading to nowhere. it kinda hurts when they never hang out.  i did have a long term relationship and fell in love with a girl on tinder. it was a good time in my life.@ tinder is pay to win. if you buy boost and super like average girls with the occasional 7 it gets you matches. i also am having a hard time getting dates as matches never respond. im not sending the generic hey message either.   and when i get matches and they respond and makes loose plans they are always busy. it sucks@ what do you think your issues are? i been lucky to almost always get follow up dates.@ you must be a handsome guy. was this online or irl?@ i really think scalp micro pigmentation looks good on all types of bald men. it gives a hairline and a buzzcut look.@ i was thinking that yesterday. saw a black guy without facial hair and i was like wow he has a hot gf and two he pulls it off well.   when a guy is pale i think it stands out way more. baldness is almost a trademark look.  on certain latino guys bald looks good as well.@ im saying after all the hard work we put into getting dates we would hope to get more of them lol.@ after all the work we put in lol.@  my friend is an army ranger who is bald and got blown up in iraq. he lost an eye~ he told me not to give up and look for any silver lining in life. he is married and has a good life despite being bald not having an eye and some face scars.@ you mean you become norwood 69 in a year?@ is bi double the fun?@ to the block list they go. thanks man! better to not kiss someones @ss@ thank you. its likely an ego boost. like look at me sorta thing. i feel like insta helps people feel like celebrities with all the attn sometimes lol.@ quit being an ass. you were first suggesting it was covid and i reasoned it probably is not. because if it was covid they would still be home. im just wondering why people do this. its one of the most frustrating things in dating.@ im just confused i dont get why give people hopes. some girl is busy saturday i suggested sunday and she said i have grocery shopping and errands. i can respect that but it seems like if i was interested i would make an exception.@ this was before quarantine but even now it continues. i can see their story on social media going out with friends and stuff so its not quarantine thats scaring them.@ and lost a war to england@ lol what is argentina? coke and messi@ most brazilians i met are from minas gerais. no offense but as a white guy id never go to brazil they will probably rob me and kill me because they hate whites.@ thats good because the usa does not care about brazil other than hookers and cheap coke.   im a white guy who would never step down to brazil. their national passtime is murder and soccer@ i agree@ where i live there is a ton of brazilians. atleast 25 percent of my town is brazilian. irish americans and italian americans blame our crime on illegals form brazil they even made the racist term brazie to refer to brazilians.@ in the united states a latino is a person from latin america or who has ancestry regardless of race. when i say latino i am speaking about this group. there are afro latinos but many are distinguishable from african americans due to culture and physicial apperance most afro latinos are mixed with amerindian and european.@ i noticed bur was wondering what latin americans thought about this in general.@ im just lonely. i dont have any close relationships in life. im not close to my family and my mother can be verbally abusive sometimes (she doesnt mean to be so harsh but its how she is).   my ex was the only person who rooted for me and cared about what i was doing in life. when she left a huge a void was made in my life and i feel so empty and hurt that someone went from being so supportive and loving to kicking me around.  i really miss her and i realize i was also a bad bf at points which made me feel like i deserve this as karma.  she has boderline personality dissorder she tends to get really close in relationships but once she hops away she attaches to someone new.@ ive had humitas and other ecuadorian food. i have been interested in ecuadors culture. the food is good and the girls are beautiful. im only familiar with people from quito but will explore around. im very fascinated with native cultures from the americas including the ones from my ancestral background.@ i have to go to ecuador@ i dont see it. i really am attracted to darker skin women. i really love the darker women from peru and ecuador they are so attractive. amerindian features are so beautiful.   white features are fine plenty of good looking whites but i find white to be boring.   where my parents come from being brown is an indio and looked down upon. even native looking people will deny they are native and claim to be spanish.   its crazy.@ hell yeah! i love selena quintanilla type of women. eva longoria is also pretty hot.@ thanks man will probably do that today.@ doesnt help im balding and broke and under 6ft.@ hahaha cmon ronaldhino was magical on the field. he still had some more potential. those brazilian teams were so fun to watch. barca with him, messi, and etoo was something i was glad to see.@ brazil is huge and i feel like its one of the most diverse nations on earth. it is also the birthplace of the greatest footballer ronaldhino lol.@ i thought brazil had a fair ammount of whites. a large wave of europeans immigrated there.@ hmm thats weird. not knocking you down but around here most will advise to get off it.  i heard that it would also be rare to get defects if on fin and getting somebody pregnant but it is theoretically possible. either way its good info to know.@ i dont get the point of this post. just about every dr will tell you to take a break when trying to concieve and to use condoms. its not like its a secret lol.   its an abundance of precaution.@ what is the point of her doing so and never meeting up? does she get a thrill from canceling??  one time i met a girl who was not stable she was a friend of a friend and would cheat on her bf 24-7 with guys at the bar. she would always be making out with someone and leaving with someone else by nights end.  she mentioned how she went out with some guy and later texted him on how she had an awesome date just to ghost him for her own sick amusement.  it makes me wonder if this girl is the same.@ 24 first dates is quite a bit lol. i get like one or two dates every month or other month. its weird almost every first date turns into something long term official or not. i been told i was peoples best date. i think the girl missed out i was gonna get drinks and give her a cool tour of the city.  i hope to find someone who really will appreciate me.@ kinda have too since covid most places require such at thw moment.@ thank you my man. i feel better just getting support from people on here. it makes me mad at how crappy certain people can treat others.@ thank you i feel a bit better. usually, my dates go really well. i ended up losing money which is sad.@ sadly looks influence so much. i dont have much to add but i know how you feel.@ i only read the headline but that was enough of a red flag for me.  this is a classic tactic cheaters use. if you wanna find out who they may actually be download whatsaap and set it up on his phone. many users have profile pictures on there. if their name is male but its some girl in the pic then thats a big red flag.  this dude wants stability from a gf and side sex.@ i only read the headline but that was enough of a red flag for me.  this is a classic tactic cheaters use. if you wanna find out who they may actually be download whatsaap and set it up on his phone. many users have profile pictures on there. if their name is male but its some girl in the pic then thats a big red flag.   this dude wants stability from a gf and side pussy.\n",

post. it does baffle me why they don't think he means defrost. i took defrost as defrost. it truly is curious to me why people keep talking about de-fogging instead. aside from the fact that you cannot even run an ac compressor in conditions where there is frost.@ why do silica packets need to be replaced? are they considered toxic now? is clay better?@ this works for de-fogging, but not defrosting, because the compressor will not operate when it is freezing. the compressor should shut off when the evaporator temperature is 32 degrees or lower to prevent icing in the evaporator, winter or summer.@ when it's frosty, the temperature is well below freezing. wouldn't frost build up on the condenser coils? drying warm by passing it over a cold surface works because water condenses on it. when the air temp is below freezing, the coils will ice up and become useless. that's why the compressor doesn't turn on when it's below freezing?@ ac may have changed. i have never had a compressor that would turn on in frosty conditions. this caused problems becauase the seal would dry out over the winter, and you would have to recharge in the spring. things may have improved. it's been a while since i have had ac.@ carrier i think.@ they were paving the new highway, and it was closed. we would park 2 cars side by side, but with enough room so that you could drive between them

needle\" when you drove between the two parked cars.   i feel guilty even mentioning this stupidity. don't do this.@ we would put 5 or 10 gallons of gasoline in a 45 gallon barrel, tighten the bung, and roll it on a bonfire and watch it explode.@ some of us would climb up 50 ft spruce trees, and the others would cut them down. we didn't have a chain saw, so sometimes it was to be continued the next day. they would get hung up in other trees, and you would have to do some really daring moves to get down. don't tell mom.@ fucking pricks!@ a/c won't turn on during frosty conditions.@ > moisture  frost? defrost is for defrosting. heat works best inside and out.  although a/c can dry the air by passing it over it's cooling coils and condensing it, warming the air expands it and lowers it's humidity.  water is more apt condense on a surface cooler than the ambient temperature than on a warmer surface.@ > turn on the heat only if it's dry outside.  seriously? you need heat to melt the frost. it's not dry outside when freezing rain is building up on your windshield. how is a cold windshield better when frost is freezing to your windshield? you have to **defrost**.   how long do your wipers last grinding on cold frosted glass? how many gallons of de-icer will you go through? how can you see through frosty ice? the best de-icer rated at 40 below still leaves ice on your windshield at minus 10 after the antifreeze evaporates off if the windshield is cold on the highway.  i have driven in canada for over forty years, and a warm window in a storm is better than a frozen one. for safety's sake, you have to see where you are going, ice and snow melt on a warm windshield, your slightest breath will freeze on a frozen one. as far as a/c, it won't even turn on during frosty conditions.   edit: i think it's your punctuation throwing me off.@ there was something exciting in the offing. challenges and milestones. new experiences.   now it's how am i going to pay for my ex's bills? where am i going to live? why do i live when i am just a dollar amount, not a person anymore?@ you must live in a warm climate. defrost is for defrosting. your rear window defrost works with a heating element on the glass to melt the frost. your windshield defrost directs air at your windshield; max heat will clear the frost the fastest obviously.  how would cold air melt frost better than warm air?@ til 30 is the new 20.@ and there's no such thing as ludes anymore.@ steve mcqueen was cool. like steve mcqueen cool. he was as cool as steve mcqueen. it's funny to see him like

choice. 10, maybe 20 minutes. at jiffy or where ever, you get an appointment at an inconvenient time, drive over there, wait around for an hour nursing a coffee with mystery powder in it, pay $20.00

seconds, they're good. they give me the same as i give my parents. i could hug them forever.  my wife wasn't a hugger, not even with our kids. i remember after a fight and make up, i would hold her.  i wanted to hold her until my heart settled down. she said \"you are really getting something from this, aren't you?\". to her, it was some sort of convention, what you are supposed to do.  we were doing mushrooms at a festival this summer. a young lady asked me for a \"real hug\". i knew she came from a rough upbringing, and i was surprised. we embraced, and she did the pat on the back thing. no, you wanted a real hug, and we embraced again, she pressed her cheek on my neck, and gave me such a sincere tight hug. that is one i will never forget. i think about half a minute.   my buddies are about 1 or 2 seconds, depending upon how many beers.@ i watched 1960s *batman* as a 7 year old. he was my hero. i wanted to be him when i grew up.  the show was cancelled a couple of years later, and

house, hop scotch, skipping, donkey. riding bikes, raiding fruit trees and climbing everything in sight.  as teens we would build tree houses in the woods, go to lake and swim and have bon fires at night. we built a big tarzan rope. made a raft out of doors and scraps of wood for wet foot fun. romance time. spin the bottle, truth or dare.   high school days were organized sports, small time weed; nickle bags and jays rolled rolled from stalk and seeds. spice bottles full of booze swiped from parent's cabinets were snuck into the dance. stealing condoms and candy from the drug store. almost all of us smoked. hitch hiking everywhere and running from trouble while laughing.@ if people didn't consume their product, they wouldn't do it. often the people that are shocked at the

at the shit you got done!\".@ i took toxic literally. fuck, i'm old.@ that's so good to hear. i love it that you made a line of communication with him. it's rare that a manager will revisit a

tower asbestos panels with a grinder fitted with a wire cup brush. after work, we'd slap some of the dust off, blow our nose, and hawk up the rest. i'm healthy, i think i got away with it. working in the harbour meant no safety rules. it was considered off shore. go ahead, climb up there. there aren't any harnesses, but your boss seems impressed. the worst tragedies were usually falls. ambulances showed up nearly every shift, don't look, mind your business, you're paid to work.   we called the labour board, we didn't know they sympathized with management. they don't give a fuck about labour, our bosses treated them to liquor and whores. people are getting killed and maimed, so we called the news, (are you still reading?). nobody gave a shit. nobody cares, you are just some man building a big thing to supply oil. flick a switch, the light comes on ; all good. you realize that your life doesn't mean shit. it doesn't. when i got some say, i ordered fall arrest harnesses, good gloves, and the cool shaded safety glasses that the boys would wear (and actually stole lol).   that guy in the suit, jumping in that little black car, would rather you die as long as it doesn't fuck up his lunch date. *i really want to shock you, but i know; nobody gives a shit*.  the last 20 years has been much better. spraying pcbs under a fume hood, face shields and safety glasses, respirators so tight that you can't smell bananas. safety shoes for no apparent reason. disposable gloves in case you touch something icky. ear defenders. hearing tests, eye tests, you get it.  i'm laid off now, and i figure nobody is going to try and figure out my reddit id. i worked on sea kings, the electronics. sikorsky invented really beautiful electronics. it's all there, individual components, right before your eyes.  i'm proud to say, everything i touched is top notch. the helicopter that you saw trump go to the hospital in is a presidential, and my finger prints are all over the ase. they are one of the few sea kings still flying (marine 1s), and have proven themselves safe and reliable.@ it's not a panacea, it's a good question in my experience though. hands go up. insight is gained, and changes are made.@ what's the point of asking, if you don't?@ i've been on the low end of the totem pole longer than the top. i don't remember us workers being asked about anything too much, unless the  bargaining with the union was due. they're like \"work harder, faster\", and stay oblivious to the roadblocks.   *but i've seen what that question can do. it is a good tip*.  when you ask \"what will make your job easier\", people talk, they offer solutions, ideas. it gets people talking to you. jesus christ, it's not the only thing. it sparks talk, *communication*.  be jaded, be suspicious. go ahead, you're right. don't believe anything management says. they are full of shit 9 times out of 10. do you see any of them participating in this conversation? i can see you weren't born yesterday.   the contempt towards labour is real. it was baked in while they got their mba, or their old man's coat tails. i'm saying to them, ask that fucking question. it will do us good.@ yes.@ an aside, i just poured one.   you know, we had an engineering student who worked with us doing ship repair. a good guy, stereo typically quiet and polite. hard hat, harness and 7\" grinder, up he went. he dealt with their decisions. we would discuss the decisions being made. he came with me to the office, and helped me deal with the germans and dutchmen. they mostly dismissed our suggestions. as we were leaving, one gave me a pen, and another gave us some pins with his flag. fuck.  the point is, avery is going to be (now he is) an engineer. what he learned working with us, while his buds were doing cushy indoor summer jobs, was real world. if i was building oil rigs, war ships, or *anything*, i would hire him.@ it might be obvious, i'm drunk. you can't reason with someone who is loaded.@ i just deleted my reply out of embarrassment. now i am even more embarrassed that i did that.  ffs, what's the point of asking if you don't listen?@ get the fuck out of there. honest to god, that place will kill you. if you are \"lucky\", it's one of those places that pays well, good pension plan and so on. i've been (lucky?) enough to work at plants like that, and when the old guys retired, we'd take them out, they would talk about the cottage etc., and die within the year. not kidding. freddy showed up at work to show us his new motorhome, you could live in that! he died on the way home of a heart attack at a gas station.  i dunno, i'm getting the feeling this is an old company that's just paying you enough to keep you there, but you can do better. a job that pisses you off, will kill you faster than liquor, smoking and deep fried everything.@ i've been a labourer in ship repair, and have dealt with the engineer ego. they won't even consider going out on the line, or below deck, because they already know everything about it, and those lazy assholes aren't doing it right. simple little things like grinding off a half inch of paint before welding crane tower pads to the deck, doesn't occour to them. \"there's no time for that. i told the captain before 3pm\". wtf?@ yes, but i think the credit is very important.  you let everyone know that 'jenny fixed the noise problem'.@ i'm not a great writer, i wasn't talking about gripes in particular. i was talking about a way to get innovative solutions in a way that has worked for us. i don't understand why you would assume antone would ask for solutions with no intentions of following through. it's an unusual assumption.@ that sucks. if you think they are being cute, say, like a beer fountain in the lunch room, bring it up the next time in front of everyone. acknowledge every good idea possible, implement what you can, and make sure everyone hears the name of the innovator again and again.@ > youre asking people for solutions to workplace problems without the intention of providing them with ways to implement said solutions  that makes no sense. if you aren't going to implement the solution, why even ask?   if you ask \"how can we become more efficient?\", you are going to get brown nose answers and suckholers suggesting heavier workloads. your workers can see shit that you can't if you aren't doing their job. asking how you can make their job easier, will open them up to innovative solutions.@ moving a conveyor belt to the other side of the room, widening a door, buying this consumable tool instead of that one. when you get a good tip, you can say \"hannah suggested we put that water cooler at the west end, is it working for you?\" you've saved some wondering, and you've showed some willingness to work with them.@ you know, marilyn is the epitome. just over, nothing else, never another. there are so many beautiful women, but god; marilyn monroe spins me.@ my god, i want to be mature, sophisticated, deep. but, holy fuck, what is it about beautiful women that gets us buzzing?  i've noticed, over my six decades on earth, that women, do indeed, recognize beautiful women. men find men generally disgusting, and are surprised anytime a woman finds one of us attractive. it seems, that if a man doesn't look funny, has an athletic body, he is probably good looking.  there are exceptions. remember tom cruise? kind of funny looking. but women were crazy over his looks.  you've got me thinking. audrey hepburn is not normal looking either, but she looks ultra feminine.  tiny chin, big eyes and so delicate. it brings out a feeling of protecting someone vulnerable. we're fools, and fall for her at a glance.  it's funny, but i've come to expect that speaking this way really angers some women. men get pissed off about women's taste in men too. wtf lol.  thanks clever_owl, for being open to an honest discussion.@ > i've always thought marilyn monroe looked like garbage  you be you.  > what does being a straight woman have to do with not appreciating a \"full rump?\"  straight women like men by definition. in general, stereo typically, women prefer muscular tight asses. muscular, not \"phat\".  if you are a straight woman that likes men with a full rump, there are plenty in north america, fill your boots.@ i'm glad you can see it. she was stunning. as far as full rump goes, is doesn't seem to work for men lol!@ you know, the prettiest girl in the office, with the same people at the shoot, would get simular results.@ it's good that we all have different tastes. i was with a woman years ago with a big nose, and kinda skinny. she had a full rump though, and beautiful eyes. nobody else could see her beauty.   you do you. who do you find beautiful?@ seriously txnforgediniron, what is going on with locked pages and censorship? sincerely, wtf is going on? i'm old, and not up on the latest sometimes. i didn't know i am a script kitty. i've never

situation of no food for 4 days before my first paycheck. when i got my first meal, a pizza, i could only eat one slice. it was like my stomach shrank. my brother ate like he did when he played sports, except he was working, and is now morbidly obese.  you're right, the skinny, high metabolism thing ends when you're grown. the appetite may not end.@ what the hell is it about her? she looks so exquisite, mesmerizing.@ what's going on? is there a proud boys page? as far as i'm concerned, anyone should be allowed to say whatever the fuck they want.  edit: if i wasn't clear, anyone means

this. i bought a shitload of beer and wine to show appreciation to our help for the occasion.  my wife said my buddies and i couldn't be trusted to pack, so we were the luggers. we couldn't afford a moving van, so it all had to be packed in pick-up trucks.  i had to drive, so the beer was for later. my wife and her sisters and friends were drinking wine and beer while wrapping dishes in newspaper, labeling boxes, explaining how to stack it, and so on.  we got the furniture and appliances moved down to our new place, but the dishes and stuff still weren't ready. my wife and her help had a bit of grapes in them, and loudly kept explaining how hard their job was. it was really hard, way harder than ours. ok fine. i looked and saw some boxes full of pots and dishes all individually wrapped in newspaper. we threw them in the truck and left with the little load.   my buddies thought we would be done by now. when is it beer time?  when we came back, nothing else was packed, and we were getting yelled at because their job was much harder than ours, and we didn't understand.  i had to get this done, with time left to treat our help to a beer, and get them home at a reasonable hour. we grabbed all the glass and porcelain and put it in boxes and drove it to our new place. we didn't wrap our precious kmart items, and broke one big cake dish that we never used. that's it.  she was pissed, but kmart still stocked it, and i got her a new one.@ oh god, i remember when blair got along side of bush with the iraq war. i'm sure he regretted it in short order.  i thought the troubles were resolved. is it still simmering?@ oh, they *would* use it against him. he never said racism isn't real, he said i'm morgan freeman, and you're mike wallace. he has confidence and security in his *self*.  i find it refreshing. this identity thing; where we even want to identify as something that isn't even where we came from. here in canada, a white woman claimed she \"identified\" as a black woman. why can't she be a person? why? you be you, and i'll be me. tribalism and identity is driving wedges everywhere.@ >  i never perceived the us as the evil empire my contemporaries did during the nineties  when i was a boy in the 60s, i saw american tv. davy crockett, daniel boone, and they poked fun at themselves with the beverly hillbillies. us 7 year olds took batman seriously. i watched the moon landing live. i saw a benevolent nation that was leading the world with righteous intentions.  but yeah; look what happened.@ that's beautiful.@ oh shit.

down in the us. thank god president carter was leading for a while.  will they ever get another like him?@ history will remember carter as a leader with impeccable integrity and a peacemaker. i can't

he retired guy.  a true good man.   respect sir.   respect.@ i'm trying to be patient. holy fuck, my buddies deal with this all the time. if you don't believe someone who is connected, i don't know what to say. they don't keep the soft shells, at least here in nova scotia (i know there is a story about someone who got one from someone) as a rule, because the meat shrinks. hard shells stay full even after they are steamed or boiled or however people away from the coast do them. there is so much old wives talk and foolishness about lobsters that is not true. i've been around it all my life, and know people on both the reserve side and the traditional side.  you:   >but a very large lobster has a chance that meat will just not fill it's shells, especially claws  that is a recently molted lobster. it's not because it's big or old. if you look inside before you cook it, it is full. after you boil it, it shrinks. that's all. that is what happens. it's not because it was 15lbs, a regular 2lb market size will shrink too as a soft shell. there are tons off other stuff we hear all the time.  from:https://lobsteranywhere.com/seafood-savvy/hard-shell-vs-soft-shell-lobsters/  >soft shell lobster meat has a brighter red color, a softer texture, and more water content than hard shell lobster meat. although soft shell lobsters are easier to crack, you will pay more for their water weight, which will cook off.  >the new shells are soft and take several months to harden, which is why so many soft shell lobsters are available in the summer and fall. the shell hardens as the lobster feeds, which also adds meat.@ it sounds silly, but the can of beer test works. pick it up by it's body, and squeeze. an unopened can of beer is hard and firm. if there is give, it's a soft shell, and it won't be full.@ i'm going to be as polite as i can. if you do not have the slightest idea, don't invent something. google it, talk to a fisher, or be quiet.  https://lobsteranywhere.com/seafood-savvy/lobster-myths/@ if the shell is squishy and half full, it's been caught out of season. a hard shell lobster is stuffed, no matter it's size or age.@ i

that depends on perspective.  it certainly does. peering down from canada as a child will certainly give a different view than seeing the us from other places in the world.  *i still root for them. i hope for them. it's some sort of baked in loyalty i guess. my grandfather fought with them in europe during wwii. i want to be proud to say they are our friend*.@ you have explained a lot. i see it on

it's a pic of a work injury. the shop teacher should put it on the wall.@ that sucks. it's sad, and life sure as hell isn't fair. i watch my tall buddies seemingly just walk off with whoever they please.  the word \"embarrassed\" is used twice in the post. *don't be embarrassed if she turns you down*. if your buddies tease you, they will do it with a smile. you gave it a shot!  if your buddies even bother to tease you about a woman you didn't even ask, they will be looking down, and shaking their heads. ok, go ahead, be embarrassed.@ > but there are plenty of reasons to be embarrassed by rejection.  people *are* embarrassed sometimes when they are rejected. they should avoid getting elected to office, or get involved in anything where thin skin is an issue.  i'm old and divorced. i married young by choice, (kids later), and never got around that much. i've caught up.  maybe a lady wants a drink; but not necessarily from me. i don't get my panties in a knot. there is nothing to be embarrassed about. nobody gives a fuck.  i would be embarrassed to myself if i didn't give her a shot.@ dog, wife, child. a man will be judged for any other reason.@ say you were born in the early twentieth century. your dad takes you to a barnstorming show when you were little, wow. flying machines.  twenty years later, you are a man with little kids. you buy them a model jet. wwii has sure changed flying.  later, you fly to paris on a holiday.  a few years later, you are watching television, watching men fly to the moon.  you have seen flying machines turn into spacecraft. popular science and popular mechanics magazine says flying cars are next, 2 years away. plausible.   5 years away. 10 years away. the dream of a flying machine for your daily commute, sitting in your driveway, for the middle class, is now ludicrous.  flying cars rip@ there was a beautiful girl that pursued me at work before i was married. i got married to another girl.  i was at the kitchen table next to her at a house party years later. i knew anything sexual was out of the question, as i was married. but i did pay her a lot of attention, and didn't know i was being inappropriate until she said \"bill, you're married now\".  oops@ those eyes are so big and kind. she looks so lovable.@ it's better to get a \"no thanks\" type reception from her than nothing at all.  no regrets.  say something, and smile. it's ok to be a little awkward. honest to god, you don't have to be witty or cool, just any talk to get her to look your way. she knows you are introverted, and if she finds that cute, good. if not, now you know.   you miss all the shots you didn't take. take a couple of breaths, and shoot. honest to god, i've been there, scared shitless, i can't even remember why; *you can do it*.@ that is so fucking sweet.  i lost my wedding band years ago. this post makes me wish i still had it. i know my girls' mom would do this. you may have started something big here.@ remember \"pick a number between 1 and 10, and a colour\"?  seven and blue by a wide margin. like both in a pick.@ it seems so random, according to a lot of people.@ that would be useful. i haven't been on dating apps, but i've been single for a year. i started to sign up once, but the hoops got bothersome.@ > or of you half naked  yeah, that wouldn't help.@ like using an image of ourselves? @ we need something that will warn you not to click on it if you are on your work computer. other than being on reddit, i wouldn't be in any danger clicking on this at work.@ someone please explain what nsfw means. i thought it meant \"not safe for work\", like porn, something politically incorrect. what does it stand for? all i can find is not safe for work.@ i've never heard of anyone buying cardboard boxes before. i've never even seen them for sale.@ yeah, she used to brag about it. she had an old can of automotive grease under the sink.@ my mother used one like that several times a week until it died in the late seventies. she took it apart every once in a while and put fresh grease in it. she was proud that she had it last even that long. this thing has survived a really long time.@ why do some people think the sight of breasts is harmful to children?@ do they still think that? i thought we were past that.@ this guy karmas.@ all good.@ i was just mounting them around the time radials were catching on. a few broken magnesium and aluminum rims, and the occasional big pop while beading.@ very true depressivedarkling.   i had the impression from op that she had hit hard financial times, but her mother was still hounding her for money even though she was irresponsible with money herself. hollering and guilt tripping etc.  i didn't get the impression that her mother was \"an out of control, raging meth head\".@ if you ask my mother, she'll tell you i still act like i'm 12. @ not good. that sucks.  some mother's ask their darlings to behave, saying please and thank you. some mother's kids walk all over them and still feel owed. some mother's kids stay home and want to be supported as adults. some mothers are perfect, financially secure, and have lots left over to give.  some mothers live on child support and alimony, buy bobbles, shoes and new curtains. some mothers feel owed too.   i believe good mothers will *scream* at their offspring sometimes. god knows the guilt trips a mom is capable of too. not good; not perfect.  op pointed out that she is not a man. i didn't think that was necessary. 20 years old is hard, but you still have to grow up.@ why i don't have time to do what you want.@ or a rolled up hundred?@ you smooth!   i worked at a garage and pumped gas, i don't know how many tools i surprised the drivers with. always great drivers.@ the hurricane is not real, it's the liberals trying to ruin the economy.@ not yet! ffs, i'm only 62.@ well, he did.   it's too good to be true, i guess. like we say around here, \"don't tell everyone, or everyone will come\".@ i saw the part where her mother was bothering her 20 year old daughter for financial help, not even rent. i guess i'm old, i didn't realize that asking someone to help out with the household was *abuse*. it's awful that her daughter feels guilty, i can't imagine someone's mom making anyone feel that way.@ that's a nice car. it makes the decision more difficult.  but it is still a stressful financial drain. you really can get from a to b for a lot less.    you could let everyone know you are in the market for frugal transportation. hold out. pay attention. i let people know i'm looking for something cheap. be patient. a freind of a freind gave me a van. did not see it coming. a freind sold me his wife's civic for $500.00 because the red paint was faded, and she hated it. i drove a ford ranger for $400.00 for 5 years because it was a 5 speed, and buddy just wanted out of his yard because it was for sale for a week.  right now, i'm driving another ranger 5 speed, 2010, 89,000km, $1800.00, because i was the first one there with cash. the ad was posted \"just now\". it runs like a dream.   bottom line, be patient, keep your ears open, and be ready to pounce. it may take a few months. have a mechanic lined up in advance that will agree to look at it at a moments notice. mine charges $100.00.@ the history of the world.@ your car's value and maintenance costs down the road matters. is this a new toyota, or a 3 year old bmw?@ well, there it is.@ > or even no contact w her.  holy fuck. it's her mother.@ as an old man who smokes, i can testify that a cough is much more \"productive\" if you are facing down.@ and slow walking. it's like costco, everyone is waddling along.@ thanks, it has been over 40 years ago though.@ if anyone recognizes this place, stfu.@ are you kidding? are you fucking kidding?  this looks like a no-sex wet dream. do not tell any of assholes where this is ('cept for me)@ i dunno. i've read that people are loudly commented on riding the bus etc. on their appearance. cosmetic surgery is common, and expected.  liposuck, big nose fix, boob explosion, get 'er done.@ be self sufficient. don't depend on your husband for a living.@ never have a baby with a man that you don't want to keep forever.@ bro, you're human. your girlfriend sounds pretty stand-up too.@ god help us.@ the music now isn't as good as the music we grew up with; said everyone ever.  well, it's not.@ oh gawd@ how do the brazilian courts handle the pretty and rich? would she be better off in the us?@ i changed tires for almost 5 years, and didn't know this. thanks.@ beautiful work. i built the 2 plywood *elegant punt*, so i envy you taking this on, and doing a stand up job.@ >this is for sure a bugged fan  grab a screwdriver and crack it open. there seems to be suspicion in the comments about spyware etc., so have a look.@ > i want to quit my job out of frustration  you are going through a hard time because of unfortunate circumstances. you can get past this, don't stomp your feet and cry.  >is there any way i can escape this?  it's harder. you and a few freinds go ahead and rent a shithole flat. we did it when there was zero work near home at 18, and moved 3000 miles for a job at a pizza joint. there will be fights, women flopping over, partyers and so on, but the sooner you take responsibility for yourself, the sooner you will be a man.  edit: a word@ it sounds like you are having financial troubles and you want her to support you. it seems that you don't like the way she handles her finances.@ only pay her money if you are 18 and living under her roof.@ i'm 62, and leave a gap large enough for people to get in. people need to change lanes, give 'em a safe place.  live and learn.  just don't block the passing lane.@ the teachers never throw the balls off the roof.@ why so many pics of double yolkers lately? i'm not getting it.@ > not even exactly sure what i'm entering and everything is really unclear.  = scam@ >i am being told i am selfish for not wanting kids  i don't understand their thinking. if you think about it, it's kinda the other way around. i answered why i wanted kids a little while ago when i was drunk. this is a c/p because lazy:  hard to explain.  because i was a kid once. i loved helping my kids get through it. they're grown up now, and when i think of them, my heart just busts.  little babies, little munchkins, can be ridiculously cute. even when you are young, you know it's a trap. when they sleep, they look like angels, and you forget the chaos they put you through during the day.  we want family.  when my kids bring my grandkids over, i am spinning with excitement.  we were all teens, so we know shit can go wrong. you are really raising the stakes; jacking it up a few levels. it is a roll of the dice, they can bring unimaginable joy, or unimaginable grief.  i can sincerely say, with all my heart, the best years of my life was when my kids were home. i know how lucky i am. i'm so fortunate to have them.  sorry about being all over the place.  if you have kids. you have family. you may be blessed with grandkids too. think about the holidays when you get old. think about how fun they are when they are growing. you will forget the tantrums and foolishness at their weddings.@ they don't give a fuck about your penis.  are you a good partner? can you protect her? will you be a good father, provider? what are her priorities? (it's not your dick).  there was a thing on 2xchromasomes a few days ago where someone joked (a little mean spiritedly) about getting a t-shirt printed saying \"i don't care about your dick\" or similar.@ i worked in the woods with a chainsaw when i was young. a few of my fingers get like this when it is cold now that i am old. we call it *white finger*.  it kills me to see this in such young beautiful hands.@ i've been hit on before by a few drunks. the last time was because i put on a blue sweater that happened to match my jeans.   i was flattered.@ i'm agonna try it. you are breaking the world of countless cats.@ i've liked her since the day she flashed letterman on his birthday. damn, she grew up fast.   she looks great, and she knows it.@ he's not angry, he's teething. give him something to chew.@ anyways, it's nap time. don't bug me unless it's an emergency.@ shush! quiet! you are an idiot, and i am the voice of reason.  but wait! my story is way better. it happened to me! listen!!!@ those are the words. fuck, thank you.@ it's easy to agree with you.@ if a woman refuses a drink, that's all. she doesn't owe an explanation. move along.@ childhood ruined; i thought it was about exploding little animals.@ this is a legit answer. i don't think diseases and movies are true cool.@ it's ok, no big deal. i can be pedantic or whatever.@ he used an archaic word that is now considered offensive. it was insinuated that he was blaming the child. do you really think that he believes the child is to blame?@ > bastard   merriam-webster 1.  illegitimate   //his bastard son  i know that \"bastard\" is often used as an insult, but don't forget what the word means. no one is blaming the child ffs. that's like saying your puppy is a bitch, and you saying don't call her that.@ my fil was a bit of a hypochondriac, and he wouldn't set a foot inside 30 years ago.@ go-carts, paintball, with budtenders.@ he kinda is.@ my acne 90% cleared up while on a one week vacation. i didn't use the stridex pads, the special soap, or the acne cream that made my face feel like it was cracking.@ there is a magician's illusion for this \"trick\". this is *not* an illusion.@ 3:38@ thanks for this. another problem is with people that want to be the \"cool\" aunt/uncle. they put impressing a child ahead of the child's well being.@ i always wonder, are they all dead now?@ no one would be surprised. i may be a little embarrassed anyway.@ what a nice thing to say!  you keep going too brother, you just made my day.@ i've been dealing with a bad romantic decision that is crippling me financially. and i've been laid off from a very awesome job.  i've been an impatient, cranky bastard for a while lately; no fun to be around.  i went camping this weekend with a bunch of 420 types. i'm an alcohol type, but they tolerate me.  weed makes me anxious, so i tried shrooms. i got a small dose from a trusted friend. i still drank whatever.  we all sat around and joked and laughed. i have never laughed so much in years. all these wonderful people around me, and i could see the sweetness in everyone. we all want to live a good life, and this weekend was that.   we're home now, and i'm getting shit done (except for right now lol).@ this is loaded.@ i see a black duck.@ put a hole near the bottom too, so you can pull the full one out.@ a lot of flying bugs are disappearing. not many of us give a shit it seems. in the past few days, i've done a lot of highway driving. normally, my grill and windshield would be a mess. nope, just a few specks. bug screens on cars are uncommon now around here.  my neighbourhood hasn't changed much in 20 years. black flies and mosquitoes plagued my my deck just last year. citronella candles and mosquito coils burning are part of the bbq routine. i have a junk drawer full left from a sale last fall. we haven't used one, none. nobody seems to have noticed. where the fuck are the bugs? where are the moths around the lights? wtf is going on? i don't miss them, but something is wrong, and nobody is noticing.@ of course, it's a fact. now he'd have even more fodder, because the average person is a little stupider.@ it was '69. of course you know, that's way a lot of us picture him even now.@ ah, the well appointed aroma of a 1976 cordoba.@ standing on a chair while holding up a window blind while you're grandmother ponders exactly how she wants it.@ weren't you ever a teenager?@ it's funny when it happens to someone else.@ this is the best. it's beautiful that you have such a fond memory. i'll guarantee every time they thought of it for years, they would picture you out there with them and smile.@ it's on private land. she's going to show me where.@ if this coleman is a buyitforlife, then all coolers are.@ > exceptions for rape and incest.  well they had better make up their minds. if it *is* murder, someone is being murdered. that's what murder is. but it's ok to murder someone who is the product of rape or incest? there are probably more people walking around who are in that category than they care to admit.@ >$950 drone  i have to congratulate them. i'll bet they could have gotten away with spending much more than that on a quad-copter. the  phantom 4 pro advanced is an awesome consumer grade drone, and $950 is a good price. don't government employees usually opt for a six figure version?@ white light, makes me feel fine  oops:  don't you know, it's gonna make me go blind@ i had a girlfriend who used to binge too. is she of normal weight? if she is, she may be bulimic. i don't know much about it, but from what i've seen, it seemed she had to get pretty full before she could bring it back up.   she was secretive about it. she would be *very* cranky until mission get stuffed was accomplished, and then luvvy duvvy after she puked. eventually, she came clean, and i was driving her to group therapy.  i re-read your post. you mention eating issues with her parents while she was growing up. i've noticed that you feel the need to tip toe around the subjects concerning her eating habits. this is very familiar. please talk to a doctor on the best way to broach this. i honestly can't remember what the circumstances were when she finally came clean to me about bulimia, but she was already in therapy.  this may be what she is going through. it is a delicate situation, and a delicate state of mind. remember, i am some idiot you don't know on the internet, not a medical professional.@ was doing an evel kneivel jump with my bicycle. smashed a testicle to clumps. i passed out. when i awoke, i kept telling myself \"the pain will be over sometime\". i was late for supper.  50 years later, my triple sized ball is almost down to normal sized.@ good. you can do it if need be.@ my roomie and i are going camping tomorrow.@ i've head people complaining about mods. i've always interpreted it as whining. but i have just seen it in real time. holy fuck, why are they sabotaging their own sub?@ thanks@ the quote has been removed, i don't know why. i happened to c/p it to a notepad file a few moments ago: edit: the format sux, sorry        america is the wealthiest nation on earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor americans are urged to hate themselves. to quote the american humorist kin hubbard, 'it aint no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' it is in fact a crime for an american to be poor, even though america is a nation of poor. every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. no such tales are told by the american poor. they mock themselves and glorify their betters. the meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if youre so smart, why aint you rich?' there will also be an american flag no larger than a childs hand  glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.      americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any american to make money. they will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. this inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say napoleonic times. many novelties have come from america. the most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. they do not love one another because they do not love themselves.       kurt vonnegut@ that was big balls. he may not be able to find them after the impact, but that was ballsy.@ i want everyone to read this. i want everyone to discuss this. hardly anyone will. frankly, i believe what he says is true, and it applies not only to the united states.   i feel angry.@ > i guess, i never have that experience. but i never think that way  good. maybe you never will. all the best.@ thank you for your contribution.@ it's ok if you hate me for saying this.   i was divorced in my thirties. i'm 62 now. i do the bar thing, the house party thing. i know, us redditers are supposed to be neckbeards, sitting at home masturbating to japanese cartoons.  i love making love to beautiful women. kiss everything, fascinated by every divot, every line and hair, never tire of the splendor. i'm fortunate just by her presence. she's here in my bed, and i am grateful. she takes it for granted, she has better options in the wings.  the woman that i fell in love with, was homely. she was a generous lover. she reciprocated oral sex. the beauties rarely do. there's nothing wrong with that.  i noticed when my love and i went out, we weren't treated with as much courtesy by the staff of the shop, restaurant, or where ever. nothing rude, just on the back burner. she never noticed. she thought it was normal. but we had fun. what a lover. *enthusiasm*. roleplay, kinks, sneaking around the corner, because right now is the time. i could not get enough of her. we were engaged. finally, the one.  sadly, she stole money from my bank account. it was a lot of money, and it caused me legal problems with my ex wife. by the time she admitted it, i couldn't even be in the same space with her.  this was years ago, and many lovers ago. *the stereotype that you mention is my experience, over and over. i've even gotten the impression that the beauties feel somehow \"owed\". the less attractive are heads above in the loving department. pretty stereotypical, eh? i feel i'm out on a limb for even acknowledging it. kinda like i'm not supposed to admit it. or say it*.@ we have signs at peggy's cove saying don't go past here. every year, tourists die because they don't listen. we don't want to put up fences.   btw, this doesn't look like peggy's cove.@ my first step is to clean my room. i haven't done it yet. are you there yet?@ stuff about people's mothers was there too.@ > if it were that black and white  well, you know nothing's that simple.@ he's hawking shamwow covid masks on tv rifgt now.@ god bless him, it wouldn't be my first choice.@ yeah, he was wrong. but he was happy to be wrong. he was blown away by a stupid little led, and he loved seeing tech progress.@ the fundamentals don't change. voltage, resistance, inductance, capacitance and so on, are the building blocks of all our electronic technology. he was an excellent instructor.@ you guys are killing me.@ what do you like the most about the way you are?@ before. when we were teens, and getting in trouble. i've always ended up back in my hometown.   i've had for sure \"lifelong\" friends in college, and work, but we have lost track of each other.@ immediate family. mom, dad, brother and sister, my kids. almost family are friends from back in the 70s. i love my roomie and our friends that come by. my neighbours are pretty cool, but i have to draw the line somewhere.@ my shoulders are a size m. my

thanks loosebutt. very informative.@ i'm kind hearted. i love a lot of people.@ as far as i know. some get a lot bigger than others, but generally, the bigger they are, the older.   i read something about codfish years ago, where we throw back the smaller ones according to regulations so they can grow. it turned out, many were genetically predisposed to be just small fish. we were harvesting the fast growers, and preserving the slow growers.@ i just clicked on \"context\". i just replied to myself. apparently i'm an idiot and had to straighten myself out.   actually, i looked back and thought i was conversing with sunkenbonemeal.@ hopefully i'll be in the top 70% where i can attract unwanted attention.   i'd like to experience being attractive to strangers.   it's just one day, so i wouldn't get too jaded i hope. but of course, it will all be from people i'm not attracted to, so that part sucks.@ manufacturing logs since 2009. come check out our huge warehouse!!!! our sales manager is crazy!!! all inventory must go, or we are floating it down the river to the mill.@ yes, that's the way we roll. i've never heard an asshole called an asshole at his own funeral!@ apparently, some are big or small independent of their age. of course, in general, older is bigger, but some 5 year old cod are much smaller than other 5 year olds. i'm not george constanza, the marine biologist, just stuff i've read.@ yeah, same around here. i read an article about codfish years ago, and that's all i'm going on. i can't see my post from here, but i think i said the same thing as you about salmon, we let the big breeders go.@ we only keep the big fish, turns out we are breeding smaller fish.  not completely true, around here, if you catch a big salmon in a freshwater stream, you gotta let her go.@ i did leave it open ended. you are paying attention. you have a right to be confused, because things *are* changing. historically, emma would have gotten all the attention. pictures of her in her cheer leading outfit, cap and gown and testimonials about how sweet she was, and rightly so.  demonte would have been forgotten. just another black kid. i'm 62, lived in a black area, and up until very recently, these people didn't matter at all. please don't forget.   things are finally changing.@ this isn't a lpt, this is a mistake. if anything, understate your position. be honest at least, or you will come across as a pretentious asshole eventually.@   emma parker has been missing for two days. police suspect foul play. she is described as an 18 year old blonde female. police would appreciate any assistance in this matter.  demonte beals has been missing for two days. police suspect foul play. he is described as an 18 year old black male. police would appreciate any assistance in this matter.   where are society's resources are going to go? when the local news broadcasts an update on the latest developments of the case, which victim is going to be their focus? some lives seem to matter more than others.@ i believe teachers live for this. the moment of payoff. you can sense the satisfaction and pride aimed at the student. ljosmyndun, i bet you did a great job. be proud.@ wow wee!@ i disagree. you must have this happen before. you probably don't remember.   edit: winky face, holy shit@ our teacher was a brilliant old guy, we loved him, but he was a bit behind on some things.@ this has nothing to do with anything, but she is a real cutie.@ never underestimate the determination of someone who just wants \"one more\".@ you can see there are no hard feelings anywhere. say cheese!@ in 2002, my electronics instructor explained to us that blue leds were impossible. a hand goes up, \"i got 'em at home\". not possible, he explains about

something, any advice? there must be some relief.@ and she would still never trade places.@ >  \"no + reason\" sign.  seriously, did they even think this would work? they may as well have said \"great view from here\".  \"sacred ground. please respect by not treading on it\", or danger, with a brief explanation, like falling rocks or whatever. reasonable people will comply.@ it was fun building go carts out of discarded stroller wheels and scrap. there was a welding shop down the street, and they would drill the hole in the front 2x4 axle, and even give us a big bolt to push through it.@ don't forget the lazy times just sitting around scraping them with your thumbnails. a black nail, and the little itchy owwie that almost felt good.@ and i've heard people ask me why i have one sleeve up, and the other down. i didn't notice.   i haven't had a date for a while.@ >  recovering from what sounds like a military brain injury  maybe, not that there's anything wrong with that@ ;)@ ha ha. it doesn't matter what i think or say right now, because i'm drunk. i always *know* i'm right when i'm drunk. i'll look at this tomorrow, see your point, and feel embarrassed probably. but right now, you're an idiot, and i'm the voice of reason.@ i hope it happens soon. i spent a few years in hamilton, working at national steel car before the strike. you're good people. i miss yez. if you remember me when this shit is over, message me and you have a place to stay if you would like to drop by.  best wishes,  bill@ your first post starts with \"you know what im trying to say, you are being willfully ignorant\". not a good start for a conversation. that's the way it appears from here. so i did click on your name, and saw a bunch of posts not published. i saw the word bubble a lot. you seem to disagree with it. you say there are no cases that came from canada. i don't want cases from canada either.  tell me. i am ignorant about why you want us to open up to ontario, like you say, because, as you say, it only has a few cases.  >health officials reported 33 new covid-19 cases on tuesday, bringing the provincial total to 40,194.   33 cases in one day, that is really good for a province with millions of people. i'm not being cute, it is *really impressive*. if you compare populations, ontario may well be doing better than ns.  the fucking virus can only spread if we move around and spread it. you can tell, i'm laid off and doing captain crazy (i won't shut up, even if i don't know what i'm talking about).   i need to go back to work, and bursting the bubble will put it off again.@ >  trying to say  what? just say it then. open to who? come on in, just promise to self isolate for two weeks like we do when we come back from abroad.  i clicked on your profile to see your posts. i don't know tey are not showing up in this thread. you mention opening up the bubble a lot. we have opened it, to new brunswick, pei, all the  atlantic canadian provinces. they have covid19 under control for the time being. i have a daughter in new jersey. we video chat. she sees rude and selfish behavior in real time, and rarely leaves her house.  fortunately, she can work from home. do you think we should open up to nj?   we could get tourist $, most of the death would come from people with less than 20 years left on the clock (including me), so is it worth it? if you are

around, she had a right to make a living. the families that she cooked for suffered death, but she maintained that that was not her problem, she moved on to new ones. she knew typhoid was bullshit,

politicians make all your decisions for you. like a bunch of children cowering between their parents legs. i dont see how people can be complacent enough to live life like that. >  >  >  > what are you going to do, wait until 3 years after the last case on the planet before you put the mask away? the media will just keep telling you it exists. they still tell you climate change is real.  how many people have died of consumption this year? we put a stomp on it. the quarantine measures were cruel by today's standards.  > i don't have it. nobody has it  people walking around in the states

1/6=0.166666667cm   or 1.66666667mm edit: i wouldn't use a tape on something that small, calipers or a micrometer.  i get what you are saying though. when i work on my deck, i still order 2x4s, 4x8 sheets of plywood, and prefer a tape in inches.@ > 1/10 of a yard is 3.6 inches  a decimal value. now you are thinking in metric. it's not on my tape. we can guess 3 9/16\", good enough. divide a yard by say 22, 345 or what ever, it gets more complicated. divide a meter (or a volt, or gram, liter~) by any number imaginable, not just 3 or 10, and the number you get is your answer. it works with current, speed, mass, etc.  take volume. an imperial quart is 40 fluid ounces, (different than weighing ounces), a gallon is 4 quarts, a barrel is ~ and the american quart is different, 32 fl ozs i think, so that changes things depending on where you are shipping.  liters are liters. a dose of cough syrup is say 10 ml, 500 doses would require a a 5000 ml jug, or 5l. the math is the same for distance, power, and so on.    anyways boomermax, we're not gonna change anyone's mind. i grew up on the old system, and still \"think\" in it a lot. but i was trained in instrumentation and electronics, and when i do calcs, i thank god for metric, never going back.  it was fun@ i saw a home movie on tv years ago. someone was feeding a bear marshmallows. after a moment, they said that's enough and walked away with the rest of the bag. the bear wanted more, so it simply attacked the human and took the bag. there was zero hesitation. shit like this can turn deadly.@ why convert? i'm saying metric is easier.   1/10 of a yard is a nuisance. 3 feet in a yard. 12\" in a foot. inches are then divided into halves, quarters, eighths, sixteeths and so on. what's 1/10 of a yard? 3 1/4 \" ? i don't want to do the math.  with metric, just plug what you want to figure in a calculator, and the answer is a convenient unit. in everything. in volume, speed, amps, mass, hertz, the units are the same and interchangeable. ask an engineer or anyone that deals with different quantities all day which is superior.@ 1 quarter of a meter? 25 cm. how many yards?   1 half of a meter? 50 cm. how many yards?   1 tenth of a meter? 10cm. how many yards?  edit: really  0.25m  0.5m  0.1m  you can express it in kilometers, nanometers, whatever, just move the decimal point 3 spaces per unit.@ that's why you had better stick to old way. repeating decimals is a symptom of the ten finger counting system. 1/3=0.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333@ put a sweater on!@ lol@ yes. i keep my house around 18c in winter, right now it's down to 23c with the ac. we're comfy lol.@ how many inches in a chain? how many cups in a peck?@ 33.3333 cm. 333.3333 millimeter, 0.000333333 klicks, you can do it in your head.@ 30c means it's hot, not arizona hot, but uncomfortable. room temp is 20c. frost hits the pumpkin around 0c.@ we've went metric in canada a few decades ago. we still ask the butcher for a pound of hamburger, check to see how many mpg we get, measure our own weight in pounds, christ, in the uk someone will tell you they weigh 13 stone. my oven is calibrated in f.@ the arithmetic is easier when multiplying, scaling etc. with metric.@ not an american, but i haven't seen it mentioned yet that all their electrical and electronic measurements are metric. kilowatts, milliamps, picofarads and so on.  my spell correct is underlining, but not helping with the fixing.@ it's a whole genre. way back in the 70s, charles bronson was taking revenge and killing everyone and anything that moved that harmed his family, because the cops just didn't have the balls premise. there were a bunch of death wish movies. there's a bunch more like that from other talent, can't remember right now.@ it is a big deal. take your time deciding. best wishes thatsroughbuddies.@ thanks. i'll keep my fingers crossed.@ women's lib protested penthouse. it made women need to live up to impossible standards, and objectified them. i don't know if it's in business or not.@ it may sound odd, but i miss penthouse. they scoured the earth for the most incredible women in the world. in spite of what the women's libs said, they were treated like queens. and their beauty was over the top.@ because yum.@ hard to explain.  because i was a kid once. i loved helping my kids get through it. they're grown up now, and when i think of them, my heart just busts.  little babies, little munchkins, can be ridiculously cute. even when you are young, you know it's a trap. when they sleep, they look like angels, and you forget the chaos they put you through during the day.    we want *family*.   when my kids bring my grandkids over, i am spinning with excitement.   we were all teens, so we know shit can go wrong. you are really raising the stakes; jacking it up a few levels. it is a roll of the dice, they can bring unimaginable joy, or unimaginable grief.  i can sincerely say, with all my heart, the best years of my life was when my kids were home. i know how lucky i am. i'm so fortunate to have them.  sorry about being all over the place.   if you have kids. you have family. you may be blessed with grandkids too. think about the holidays when you get old. think about how fun they are when they are growing. you will forget the tantrums and foolishness at their weddings.@  i forgot. i remember now.  it's been so long since i've heard this. i hear all the stuff from my youth on the classic radio stations at work, but it has been a long time. so good to hear a gem that hasn't been beat to death for decades. nice.@ you guys just made my day. still laughing. god bless you all.  edit: tineye says this has been around. still funny tho@ @ and if you type in \"lesbians\", there are still dicks showing up.@ god bless the little buggers. i think your man is just jealous.@ those poor bastards. don't they know they can print off a medical exception on facebook?@ you might try sneaking them some sugar. mmmm, they love that. don't tell your man, just between you and me.@ it's nice to hear they are enjoying themselves at your place. the main thing is, is that they are happy.@ i'm 62, and have never pulled it off.   \"have a regular schedule\" they said.   i worked 7 twelves without a day off till christmas. five months. 3 or 4 hours sleep a night for five months. all day at work, i'd swear i was going to sleep as soon as i got home. i could fall asleep with my eyes open. i even had little dreams with my eyes open. it sounds doable, but 3 or 4 hours a night starts to wear you down over time.   get home, duties and chores, sit down to unwind, and wide awake. five hours till shift start, and i'm quietly slinking around reglueing the front of a kitchen drawer, trying to not wake anyone up.  reset all you want, but something about the rising sun just seems to knock me out. any one else?@ i do the reset too. zombie through the day, and boom, asleep in the evening. two days later, here i am on the east coast at 3:50am and zooming.@ honestly, i don't miss them, but i was prepared with a drawer full of coils this year; and nothing. it's a little freaky after over 60 years of torture. something is different.  no moths around my porch light. no bugs on my windshield after a 5 hour drive. no black flies. **no black flies.** i'm not complaining,

relatives).  we did do some s and m before, but there was no way i could feel comfortable punching her in the face. as far as the rape part goes, that involves another level of serious trust.@  i know

      "cant argue with any of that.@ could be there is more to it than just the type ii diabetes. that, anxiety, depression, and perhaps low t.@ very insightful reply. thank you. i will ponder. <3@ i dont know if i am impatient or he is slow, or a combination of both. i know he has been making doctor visits and is reportedly working on his anxiety and other issues. time is ticking though. a lot.@ his health status is a concern. it is harder to accept to a roommate relationship knowing he could become disabled by his type ii diabetes, and i am not all in for that with a relationship that isnt everything i want.@ i think having experienced what it is like to be intimately connected with someone makes it so much harder to not have that anymore, even if you love him and do not see yourself without him in your future. i am like you in that i am also becoming more and more guarded about how much affection i give, because i dont want to pressure him, and it is putting a distance between us for sure.@ you are right - even if it doesnt lead to sex, i still want to have those passionate kisses that make you feel really connected with each other. we do not have that. we have a hello and goodbye kiss, and a lot of hand holding. i have told him this, to no avail.  re: your question in paragraph 3, what he actually said was, my biggest fear is losing you because i am not good in bed. so clearly his confidence is nil, and he seems resigned to not trying to up his game.   i know that it is possible to have an intimate romantic life without an erect penis. my prior relationship was actually with a man who had ed due to prostate removal, and our sex life was great without piv sex, because we used other methods to satisfy each other, and we shared a lot of romantic kisses. i have told my current bf this, and he said he was reassured to know that i was ok with working around it. but he has made zero effort! i just wish he wasnt so friggin passive about the whole thing.@ im sure there is some baggage there. i divorced 10 years ago from a man who routinely dismissed me as an unappeasable shrew for merely wanting him to be an equal partner in the marriage. it has shied me away from being too demanding/vocal with my wants and needs.@ i think the thing that keeps me anxious is the just not knowing where he stands. i dont want to add more pressure to him by harping on it~ but months are passing and he isnt letting me know anything. i did ask him point blank if he wanted to just consider that we are in a sexless relationship, and he says no he doesnt want that. so, where does that leave me? how long do i wait around before i ask what is the status? if i do that, it adds more pressure on him. its a catch 22. if i dont say anything, i am giving the message that i dont care. expectations are the problem here i think. do i want to just silently assume we are not going any further with intimacy? if so, that changes my expectations and behavior toward him, and we are essentially no more than companions. i do not want to share my bed with a companion.@ pretty much anything by m. knight shyamalan.@ i feel exactly the same way and have a similar dilemma. i know for myself if i think there is a chance we could become intimate, i make damn sure i am clean and nice smelling! we should not have to \"mom\" them and be forced to spell it out. it's a huge turnoff. @ to me it is more about the hygiene thing than the weight thing. if he was clean and smelled good, would you still feel the same way even if he didn't lose the weight? i'm with you, my olfactory perception colors everything. i just cannot get excited when my partner has bad breath and body odor.@ thank you for your reply. i will mention it to him. we have tried viagra and it had zero effect. :(@ sounds painful :o@ \" im at that point now where i would rather be single and wait for the right one\" -- are contradictory phrases. how will the right one find you if you are decidedly not entertaining opportunities for that?  it would be better to make a decision to hone your \"next!\" skills. keep dating, but learn to very quickly move on from guys who clearly are not a match. does something raise your antenna early on? if so, it isn't getting better. goodbye, next! yes, it's brutal, but you deserve to have and uphold your own standards.  a perspective shift is what's really needed here, if you want to ultimately find the \"right\" mate.\n",

recommend 31 as that is one of the rare newer seasons that is actually quite good.@ make it through these two games unscathed and the possibility skyrockets. you would have cincinnati, indy, and cleveland. all three are winnable and with the chiefs on the steelers tail, resting the starters doesn't seem likely in week 17. i can see 16-0@ this isn't anything new. one could argue this began around season 14 (aka the transition era of the show). this was around the time where flight drama became less and less mostly due to improved technology. there was no need to frantically rush from counter to counter to find the best flight. second of all, in more recent seasons possibly due to budget, everyone typically is required to fly on certain predetermined flights already picked out by the production, which is another reason why you don't see much drama involving airports.     for the last point, maybe there are equalizer legs, but they just don't show them anymore? i know the editing of the show has changed throughout the years and that's surely a possibiity@ make an alliance only if it's to my teams benefit. running the race yourself can really backfire in certain situations so it's always best to befriend another team, especially early on in the race, so that you don't get screwed by flight issues or things of that nature.@ 20 was a lousy season and is often said to be one of the worst seasons of the show and i'd agree. dominating teams and very little suspense or interest. i know some people love drama and dominant teams but i do not@ season 6 is a prime example. one of the best routes of the series, but has one of the most unlikable casts of all time. ruins the season@ this game had an unusually bad feel to it. the defense played well but man the offense really stunk it up big time. perhaps it was due to the lack of practice? so maybe i should cut them a break because the game kept on getting postponed, but that offensive performance was putrid. and the rushing game was terrible - against mostly backup players. if they can't run the ball against backups, that spells trouble down the road.  i have confidence they turn it around, but this is one of those rare times where i am not happy about this teams performance. a win is a win, but this didn't look good.@ gimmick season are generally *not* well liked by many fans. seasons 26 and 28 are often cited as being some of the worst recent seasons of the show. seasons 29 and 31 are little more well received, but barely.  old school seasons> new seasons@ this team is really good and i think they can make a serious run to the superbowl. they're winning close games that they would usually lose- which is a good sign. the media pundits always like to point out that the steelers barely beat dallas or barely scraped by a then 5-1 ravens teams on the road coming off a bye after a tough physical game against tennessee, but who cares about them?  i am convinced this lousy outing against baltimore was an outlier and things will look better from here on out@ cameron wake  terrell suggs  clay matthews   would you think the steelers sign any of these free agents or not?@ lol@ cry@ the steelers hardly practiced due to the ravens game being postponed multiple times which likely explains why they played rusty today. they hadn't played for 10 straight days either so i give them a break with this one.   so many people saying the steelers suck and their offense is trash fail to realize that they were off for 10 straight days and were in constant flux of are or are we not going to play a football game.   good teams find a way to win even on bad days. and that's what the steelers did@ tomlin cancelled practice 3 times due to ravens covid issues. i was expecting a better offensive showing, but this rusty performance isn't exactly shocking either. you are just overreacting. the steelers average 30 points a game and this is just one game out of 16.    tl;r this is just a weird game where the players had very little practice and you just kind of expected this kind of rusty performance. it won't last.   i do however, agree with fichter being a bit of a problem. i've seen the offense click when ben is leading them and then it stalls when you have randy calling a run up the middle on 2nd and 10 for 2 yards@ steelers could still run up the score even without their starter in@ where am i at , they had the local black and gold zone show on@ why are people so paranoid about a statement? this has no effect on the game whatsoever@ dobbins and ingram aren't even pittsburgh as of right now. if they were playing today, they'd be here by now@ the superbowl is 2 months away and the draft is 5 months away. there's a difference@ the draft is so far away that it is somewhat pointless to talk about it now. wait until the season finishes out and then begin talking about potential draft prospects.@ qb - jacksonville. they have glennon, lutton, and minshew, none of which are very good.  wr - jets. their wr core consists of jamison crowder, denzel mims, breshad periman, and braxton berrios. easily one of the worst groups at this position.  rb - texans. the texans running backs are duke johnson, c.j. procise, and scottie phillips, and their run game has been nonexistent all season long.  te- cardinals. they only have two active te's on their roster and they don't use them a lot, dan arnold and maxx williams.  ol- cowboys. right now, they're ravaged by injury and they just aren't playing well.  dl- bengals. they don't get great pressure and don't have many sacks  lb- jaguars  cb- seattle is still playing historically bad in this area. they are giving up huge yardage to opposing qb's  s- ????@ the politically correct culture is at it again. fucking crybabies@ i think 14 is pretty good and 15 is more mediocre than bad imo@ season 7 was a season i was initially fond of, but for whatever, grew less fond of as time went on. lyn/alex/patrick's obsession with rob and amber grew tiring after awhile. the amount of focus this season had on rob and amber was over the top. the finale really stands out as being as the best thing about this season as uchenna and joyce barely win. i thought the cast was just ok and it some likable teams such as uchenna/joyce and meredith/gretchen.  my opinion on this season though has just soured over the years for whatever reason@ there's a trend with all-star seasons where the least deserving team/person always wins - and that was the case here. eric and danielle weren't even dating at that point and it was just awkward to watch. i wanted to see charla/mirna or even joe/bill win but whatever. the winners alone really bring this season down into the middle tiers for me. not bad, but not great either@ they didn't start it, that stupid coach did. and they'll still be without many key players on the defense and the offense, so it's not like they hold *that* much of an advantage, if any at all@ i see 3 wins@ an opinion is an opinion whether you like it or not.@ andre and damon were in morocco and got extremely lost and eventually got detained in a deserted location in the middle of nowhere. in the next episode, they were heading to the pitstop in germany and they missed the stop they were supposed to get off on and went in the wrong direction got lost@ people are allowed to express their opinion whether you like it or not. it may be bigotry and you may not like it, but so what? if you don't like what this person said, you should have paid this person no mind.@ seasons that i would recommend skipping and why:  6 - unlikable cast and too many couples in this cast dragged this season down  13 - this is a strange season. you had the first truly dominant winners and two teams combined to win 10 legs. russia was boring and dan/andrew weren't funny.  20 - season 20 is mixture of 6 & 13. dominant winners and an unlikable cast with a ton of drama. the final 4 were terrible.     most of the commonly cited \"bad \" seasons are salvageable imo. season 4 gets better as the season progresses. season 8 isn't that bad. season 9 starts strong but the focus turns to two dominant teams which is boring. the locations were nice though. season 14 has a great cast and yes the route is very boring, but that cast makes it enjoyable. and season 24 had terrible tasks but was otherwise an ok season@ you have a right to express your opinion, but you come off sounding a bit childish by saying ew@ baker is a game manager, nothing wrong with that. they run the ball really well and then call baker to make throws when necessary. however, if they want to win in the playoffs, baker needs to play better.@ 1. steelers are scoring close to 30 a game 2. the defense is top 5 in almost all meaningful categories 3. if the steelers secure the #1 seed, come january, the steelers would hold the advantage because cold weather is not conducive to throwing the ball  i'm not saying the steelers would beat the chiefs, but they would hold a slight advantage over them. the chiefs offense is electric, but offense doesn't travel, especially in frigid january cold@ i don't think so.   for example. say if mahomes goes and scores with say~. a little over 2 minutes left on the clock. chiefs lead 34-32 and the opponent gets the ball back with a little over 2 minutes left. if the opponent moves the ball methodically down the field and gets within field goal range, the chiefs could end up on the losing end for once.  i think the chiefs have gotten incredibly, in regards to not being on the losing end sans that loss to the raiders. if they don't shore up the defense though, it will bite them eventually perhaps late in the game when they need to get a crucial stop.@ if the bucs defense can hold mahomes to under 30, i'd like to see how the saints and steelers do against them. they play the saints later in the season, but they very well could meet the steelers in the playoffs and that could be interesting. pittsburgh has a better overall defense and that should make it tough on mahomes.@ this loss was shocking. losing to the falcons would've been kind of shocking/expected especially coming off a near loss to kc. but getting ran out of the building by a bad falcons team is embarrassing. are the raiders really a playoff team? good thing they have the jets up next@ didn't brady throw for 340+ in a half way back in 09'?@ besides the obvious answer, i'd say the saints or rams. the rams need goff to be more consistent to be a serious superbowl contender.  i'd also say the steelers but the steelers are going to be losing some key players in the offseason which could spell trouble@ chuba hubbard and najee harris are potential options for the steelers. travis etienne is a multi-purpose back, but i don't know if he'll fall all the way to the end of the 1st round.@ i just want to watch an nfl game where a team has no qb. i don't think i've ever seen a game  that had a team without any of their qb's playing. should be fun, in a bad way@   maybe they could play here? looks big enough for an nfl game@ i'll root for the lesser of the two evils here and root for the bucs.@ the chiefs are the biggest threat without question. steelers have a great defense, but the chiefs have so many weapons that all you can hope for is to slow them down.  as for in the nfc, there isn't a team that really stands out as being especially scary. the rams, however, would be the worst possible matchup in the superbowl. their defense is legit and if the performance against the bucs suggest anything, i'd be worried.@ doug marrone could be on the hot seat if he doesn't find his franchise qb soon. bortles, minshew, lutton, and now glennon. this franchise is going nowhere anytime soon and if they don't find their qb, marrone could be shown the door. outside of that 2017 run, the jags have been terrible ever since. he should be on the hot seat.@ i feel like the cardinals and the bills are the two closest teams to potentially winning a superbowl. both have great qb's, good offenses, and ok defenses. i think they have a good chance within a decade or so.    on the other hand, i think the jaguars and the bengals are in the worst position to win a superbowl. the jaguars still haven't found their franchise qb, have a porous defense, and one of the worst owners in the nfl.  the bengals found their man in burrow, but have a bad o-line that seemingly can't be fixed, a terrible defense, and an owner that is a cheapskate.@ welp@ i love that college basketball is back, but i'd be lying if i said i'm enjoying it so far. basketball without crowds is definitely a bummer and most of the early season matchups are lousy.     notre dame vs michigan state   virginia tech vs villanova  are the only decent matchups of the day@ matthew stafford is just a terrible fit in detroit although i wonder if that has more to do with the coaching than stafford himself. i think he'd be more respected on another team like the colts or 49ers.    if you were to take russell wilson and put him on the titans, i don't think we'd regard him as highly as we do now. tennessee is such a run heavy team that there would be no need for wilson to throw much and we would lose a lot of what makes wilson so fun to watch.@ the bears.  they're one decent qb away from being elite. they already have an elite defense and all they need is a *decent* offense to go along with it. right now, the bears offense just stinks and they need to get a better qb if they want to seriously compete.@ does joe burrow count?   he has a porous offensive line and has to compete with three other highly talented teams in the afc north.@ you can film anything you want~.. until the cops approach and arrest you@ why would you want to go around filming on duty law enforcement in the first place? in that case, they'd have every right to question you as to why you are doing so without a specific reason@ good. people shouldn't be filming an arrest they have no business in. keep moving or you're going to jail.@ fans often cite this season as one of the worst of the early seasons and i disagree. many of the teams were likable enough and easy to root for. the bransen family and the gaghan family were my two favorite teams of the season. this season does slow down a little in the back half, but it never gets actively awful. family edition is an enjoyable season that i enjoy watching.  and it surely is better than some of the other early seasons@ i'm one of the few people who actually enjoyed the family edition. i wouldn't mind seeing another one@ if the ravens were to forfeit the game, it would be the first time in nfl *history* that a team has ever forfeited a game. could it happen? i can see it. will it happen? probably not@ this post is trash@ the lions have been playing on thanksgiving for 80 straight years. the cowboys have been playing for 50 straight years.  the lions are not really \"bad\", just incredibly mediocre. jim caldwell was 3-1 on thanksgiving games. and the cowboys are having an unusually bad year, so it's not like they're always a bad team.   and they make the schedule before the season begins. you could've made a case that the lions were going to be bad and the wft were going to suck, but there was no way to tell that dallas and houston were going to be terrible.   and besides, football is football. i'm willing to bet the same people complaining about the \"terrible\" game also watched the game too.@ washington by 7@ patricia should be fired, but he probably won't be@ i was bothered by it at first, but i figured it was a smart move because why risk having steelers players possibly get the virus? i know it's an unpopular opinion, but would you rather play them on thursday and risk getting the virus or wait until sunday and not get the virus?    the players have every right to be angry about the move@ i read somewhere that al michaels was off this week and if this is the case i wonder who will call the game, considering snf.    my guess is they have tirico and dungy call the steelers/ravens game and then they fly all the way to chicago after the game so that tirico can be in the booth next to collinsworth to call the bears/packers game.@ it has to be the 4:25 slot along with kc and tb. there are just too many games in the early window, unless they want to make it a local game where hardly anyone sees it@ i hope the steelers give the ravens the business for this@ why the hell are we getting the browns/jags game? seriously pittsburgh?@ the nfc is quite muddled right now, so the bucs have a chance. is there a clear favorite? maybe the saints?  the rams have a great defense but an offense that can be on and off. goff did not play well in the 2nd half against the bucs.  green bay has a high scoring offense but the defense isn't great.  seahawks are the same as green bay  arizona plays in a crowded nfc west and may not even make the playoffs    the nfc isn't bad, but there isn't a clear frontrunner like in the afc except for the saints.@ who cares? let them keep doubting the steelers and hopefully the steelers prove them wrong by winning the superbowl at the end of the season.  as to the running game, they have a point. it *isn't* where it needs to be. i looked up team stats and the steelers rank at #21 when it comes to total rush yards per game, which is in the bottom half of the nfl. not good. the steelers are good team, but even good teams have their flaws.@ mvp- aaron rodgers  opoy - dalvin cook  dpoy - t.j. watt  oroy- chase claypool/justin jefferson tossup  droy - dunno  cpoy - ben roethlisberger  coty- mike tomlin    i know it sounds like i'm being a steelers homer, but all of them are really strong candidates for the respective rewards.@ matt lefleur has a regular season winning % of .783 while shanahan's is .474    the worst qb play argument doesn't work because mike tomlin managed to go 8-8 with hodges and rudolph who are both terrible qb's. if shanahan is a great coach, he should be able to at least get close to .500 with bad/mediocre qb play. if tomlin can do it, why can't shanahan?@ the colts. they are playing excellent defense and could give pittsburgh big problems in the playoffs.@ matt lefleur  bill belichick  mike tomlin  andy reid  sean mcvay  pete carroll  sean payton  frank reich  john harbaugh  brian flores@ who the hell cares what a journalist says?@ the ravens have two of their starting rb's on covid reserve lists and are out for this game. campbell and smith are questionable for the game as well. and i think i read somewhere that the ravens are playing with only 4(??) cb's on the active roster on thursday, so the steelers should have a field day if that is the case.     the steelers bills game is harder to predict but i think the steelers can win that one as well.@ why is it a big deal?  the nfl has been known to be behind the times when it comes to many issues, just look at the whole colin kaepernick thing and the kneeling for the flag incidents. so yes, i get the significance of having an all black officiating crew. i'm glad to see an all black officiating crew, although who really pays attention to the referees anyway? however, i don't understand why people are going overboard with the reactions.@ people make such a scene over it being an all black officiating crew. congrats. what else do you want? a celebratory party for this special achievement? let's watch the game.@ cam newton signed a one year deal with ne and he never said that he would return to ne next year. i could never see it happening, but i would love to see cam as the steelers backup qb. you could say cam has played poorly/regressed, but his team isn't very good. he has no one to throw the football to.     realistically speaking, a qb i'd love to see be the steelers backup isn't even in the nfl right now and that is kyle trask from florida.@ gotta make such a big deal about *everything.* first all black officiating crew? congratulations, now let's get to the game@ \"*i've never wanted a sb as bad as i do this year\"- you are not on the team*    *\"i'm talking mad shit if we win\"- if this steelers win, you wouldn't have won it, the steelers would've because they're the ones on the field playing, not you.*    *you care way to much about rankings and take it personally*@ i wonder if the ravens are \"feigning\" it in, just so they can have a few days of extra rest before playing the steelers. i know it sounds crazy, but it isn't too far fetched~.@ on a positive note, they're in prime position to draft penei sewell out of oregon to give them some help on the ol  on the down side, the rest of the ol is still terrible. hope burrow makes a quick and speedy recovery@ \"the rules of the game\" is actually a french film called la  regle du jeu. unless you are an extensive film buff, you most certainly have never heard of that movie. once again, the story of the last chrysanthemum is a foreign movie even many diehard moviegoers likely never heard of. i'll give you only angels have wings.    the purpose of this list was to illustrate why 1939 was a better year in movies than 2014 by providing *clear* examples as to why it is better than 2014. gone with the wind and the wizard of oz are a lot more recognizable than those two foreign films i mentioned in the previous paragraph.@ steelers steamrolled the jags by 24 points, what do you expect? ten-bal went to ot and kc-lv was good until the end. nice win by the steelers, but not really a game worth mentioning@ the movies i listed are big name movies any person semi- interested in film would recognize. the movies you listed aren't exactly movies that stand out to most moviegoers. are they good movies? yes, but for the purpose of this thread, i've only listed movies that are more recognizable to filmgoers.@ i hope for the chiefs to lose to both the saints and buccaneers. the steelers then secure the #1 seed by week 15 so they rest their starters for the colts game. most likely drop to 15-1. have the starters play against the browns and finish the season at 15-1.    i say that because you don't want the steelers to be like the ravens last year. rest their starters, be off for 2 straight weeks and then lose in the divisional round.@ barney miller was the most realistic cop show of it's time and had the most realistic look of a police station of it's era.@ sanford and son  happy days  i love lucy  the jeffersons  here's lucy    because tv has been around longer than 20 years you know?@ 1939:  1. gone with the wind 2. ninotchka 3. mr. smith goes to washington 4. at the circus 5. the wizard of oz 6. goodbye mr. chips 7. gunga din 8. wuthering heights 9. stagecoach  quality>quantity. more movies doesn't always equate to being better. sometimes less is more, and this is why 1939 is the best movie year of all time@ planes, trains , and automobiles  animal house  close encounters of the third kind@ they've beaten the teams they're supposed to and got trounced twice by teams that were way better than them@ \\- 6 superbowls  \\- ben roethlisberger and his incident from a decade ago  \\- mahomes and the chiefs have the \"sexier\" team right now    the media hates the steelers much like how they hated the patriots. they're successful and they aren't that \"sexy\" of a team like the chiefs or seahawks, that the media likes. and the steelers *are* putting up 30 + points a game, so it's not like they have a bad offense@ 1. can't lawrence choose to return to clemson? 2. couldn't he also force a trade if he *really* didn't want to play for the jets?@ you have the raiders, colts, titans, and dolphins all vying for wildcard spots, along with the browns. they could easily fall out of contention@ can't we just enjoy being 10-0? it seems all people want to talk about are supposed \"trap\" games.@ know what's even funnier?    even with a 7-3 record right now, the browns would still need help to get into the playoffs@ i think pitt learned their lesson against dallas. they blew a red hot cincy team that many thought could upset the steelers out of the water. i doubt pitt plays poorly like that again@ the film is not captain courageous as backgrounds and exteriors were filmed on location in newfoundland and nova scotia and gloucester massachusetts    the movie also can't be mutiny on the bounty (1935) because the movie description says the film took place in portsmouth, england and tahiti, which is located in french polynesia. if the op is correct that this scene took place in coastal chinese town, neither of these movies are correct.     i'll take a wild guess and say that this movie could possibly be \"the yankee clipper\" from 1927. it is really obscure and was produced by cecil b. demille. it was distributed by the producers distributing corporation. you *did* say that this scene likely took place in a coastal chinese town and from the description that i've read this movies plot at least to part in china.@ i've always loved these old frankie and annette beach movies. if you appreciate them for what they are, entertainment, they are a thrill to watch.@ tian and jaree grated on my nerves and jon/al were lame@ season 4 actually got *somewhat* better for me on the rewatch. the route was a drag and the top 3 was lousy, but i felt like the season improved as more teams got eliminated. it's still bad, but i'd still watch season 4 before i would ever watch season 6 again.@ i made it all the way to episode 11 before i called it quits on the season. this season is the most hated of the classic era, and for good reason. the cast is just so *unlikable and unbearable to watch.* i don't have a favorite team.@ what power? they're getting by on luck these past few legs@ as a steelers fan, i'm a fan of joe burrow. hard to hate the guy. does that count as unpopular?@ psu has played osu the toughest over the years, but i wouldn't call it a rivalry,per se.@ this team does feel different, and i don't really get the fans who are always waiting for that \"trap\" game. like geesh, just enjoy the run the steelers are having and if they lose they lose.@ didn't the jags lose most of their starting defense that gave the steelers fits years ago? i think the only guy left is myles jack. and they're starting a rookie qb in jake lutton. and they're likely tanking for a qb, so they have no incentive to win this game. i'm optimistic the steelers will win by 10+. it's almost as if fans purposely want the steelers to lose.@ don't forget season 10's backpack alliance. bama girls used the alliance to get all the way to final three.@ i'm not usually a fan of the modern day seasons of the show myself, but the show has gotten better recently with seasons 31 and the current season. the casting department has done an excellent job of finding interesting teams to cast who interesting to watch. of course, you have some duds (rupert/laura, art/jj for example), but that's in every season.  i could, however, live without phil's quirky narration. i don't really like it.    *if you don't like the current season of the show, just stop watching it then. there's no need to complain about it or hate- watch it.*@ headphones. it helps especially with the loud breathing at night i have to hear and the loud chewing/lip smacking. the ear damage is worth not having to hear the sounds.@ cool@ looking at their schedule, i see three potential losses. they've already beaten baltimore at their place so why can't they beat them here? the colts looked ok against the ravens in the first half but got manhandled in the secondhalf. the steelers should take care of the colts. the bills game is 50/50 depending on which bills team the steelers see. do they get the bills team we saw vs the seahawks? or do we get the team that played so poorly against the jets?    i'm not as pessimistic about going undefeated as seemingly many fans are. i'd put their odds at 35%. if they avoid trap games, they have a very good shot.@ s3  s5  s10  s12  s21    i'd also recommend s14, but people either love or hate that season. i personally love it so~.@ the older seasons had a lot more \"average\" teams on the show. you do have \"average\" teams on the show today, but they're more aware of the camera nowadays than they were in the past. that's why many of the newer teams seem to be more interesting to watch. they're aware of the camera, so they play *too* the camera    tl;dr older teams from seasons 1-12ish were less aware of the camera unlike many modern teams today, which is why they seem more boring@ best season is season 5. the best route of all time and had the greatest cast of all time.  worst season is season 6. unlikable cast makes this season genuinely unwatchable. 24 may be the absolute worst of the bunch task wise, but 6 takes the cake in terms of cast. season 20 is a close runner up.  season 1 is a tad below the top tier. i love season 1, but i don't think it belongs at the top with seasons 3, 5, or 12.@ despite two straight losses for oregon state, i think they're a decent football team. they lost by a score to the huskies and by 10 to the cougars. are they a great team? no, but i think they can improve as the season goes on because looking at their schedule, they have winnable games against cal and stanford.@ i watch college football on saturday so i agree with you@ well at least the pitt/jags game doesn't get the d crew.@ my realistic expectation is 15-1 at a minimum. they should handle the jags and washington. the browns week 17 should be a w too. the potential l can be taken against baltimore, bills, or colts. two out of three are at home.  my guess is they lose to the ravens because if the titans beat the ravens, i can't imagine the ravens losing 3 straight in a row.@ this is what happens when global warming gets out of control. if humanity doesn't do something, it'll get much worse@ frasier is very similar to cheers in many aspects, but cheer is more of a *blue-collar* show , whereas frasier is a tad more sophisticated in it's humor. i'd still give it a try to see if you like it, because they are very similar. both are very funny shows.@ jameis winston 2.0@ the 2020 steelers have a solid offense and an elite defense  the 2017 steelers had an elite offense that underperformed at times , and also had a suspect defense that had holes at the back end positions.    the 2020 iteration of the steelers is better because they're beating the teams they're supposed to beat, they have a complete defense, and are doing just enough on offense to win games. not to mention, brady is gone, so the patriots stink now.@ j.j. watt  not only is he a great de, but he is a great person of the field as well@ ok@ who did they beat?  a 1-3 michigan state team  a 0-4 penn state team  a 1-2 michigan team  a 1-2 rutgers team  their opponents win- loss total is 3-11  impressive~.@ i think were neck and neck with kansas city. i'd give the edge to the steelers because i see them as the more complete team overall. great defense with solid offense and ok special teams.    what really annoys me are those \"experts\" (stephen a. smith and colin cowherd as two examples)  who refuse to give the steelers their credit. they say the steelers have barely won close games, yet refuse to acknowledge that kansas city lost to lv and barely beat an under .500 carolina team in kc. the hate for the steelers is strong.@ true@ i feel sorry for marlins fans. they've been sucking for years and they're going to continue sucking for years to come under her watch.@ is the coronavirus racist?@ i like the early seasons in the fact that production would cast certain kinds of players you'd *never* see on a modern season of the amazing race. colin was a very cutthroat player in season 5 and very entertaining to boot, but *that* kind of player would never be cast of a new season of the amazing race.@ who's fault is that? it's not productions fault that all black teams tend to go out early in the race. what do you want them to do? rig the race so that they make it farther? that's just luck of the draw.   both black teams didn't go out because of an alliance between two white teams. the olympians went out because a) they had taxi trouble and fell behind and b) they had trouble at the roadblock with the horn and were battling with the *other* black team jerry and frank to avoid being eliminated. they presumably got out of the taxi farther away from phil than jerry and frank, which is why they got eliminated.    jerry and frank got eliminated because of their own mistake. they were completing the market task and failed to take their groceries into the boat and made the same mistake that michelle and victoria did and forgot their groceries. had they not forgotten their groceries, even if they *were* u-turned, there's a good chance they could've survived and leo and alan would've been eliminated. there was no alliance.@ kami from season 5  cara season 14  christie from season 31@ i didn't like the linz family much. they seemed very immature, especially the boys. i would've loved to seen the bransen family win but oh well@ she is *ugly!*@ i think that's a rarer form of sad. most people who have sad have it during winter instead of summer. interesting.@ where i live, it's the opposite. in the summer, the days are longer but the temperatures are usually very mild or too bad. in the winter though when the days are shorter, the temperatures are atrocious. go outside on any given day in winter and it's likely to be 30-60 degrees, which is chilly.@ i would too lol@ depends on your job. if you work a 9-5 i can agree. but if you work off the clock hours or weird shifts, you may not miss the sunlight during the winter.@ i like summer for that reason as well. although for me, i'll still go for walks in the dark, what gets me is the chilly weather. it's often too cold in the late fall/winter to go for any kind of walk.@ i hate that it gets dark at 5 in the evening. even worse when you go to look at the clock and you're extremely sleepy and you see it's only 7:30 lol.@ cbs is trash.@ i like the longer days as well. the shorter days really mess up my sleep routine and to top it off, it's cold too, which sucks@ i agree@ not surprising. pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers out there and one of the very few that is incurable. rip@ and you usually have to pay a sizable chunk of money on cable just to be able to get internet and wifi too.@ i live in pa so i'm on the fence about the heating. it doesn't get terribly cold most of time, but for maybe 2 weeks out of the year, it does get really frigid. i may just settle for a heater.@ harris is traaaasssshhhhh@ harris sucks donkey dick and was chosen by biden just so that he can get more votes@ i'd rather have tony the tiger for president than harris. at least he'd do a better job@ i never had a good female figure in my life, which is why i have the view of women that i do. my stepmom was awful and a narcissist.@ females are incapable and i'd be scared to live in an america with a female ruling as president. give me an old white guy for president. people are more likely to listen to them.@ dallas is literally starting a qb they just signed off the browns practice squad. the steelers should win by at least 25.points.@ america will be in trouble because his vp is a female, and a very poor choice at that. if you were going to choose a female as your vp running mate, you should at least choose someone who is at least capable. harris is not.  skin tone has nothing to do with the comment. i loved barack obama as president, so it has nothing to do with that.@ nope@ that's disappointing. i was hoping to see mike pence as vp instead of her but oh well. if she ever becomes president, this country will go down the toilet~.. oh wait, it already has. it'll be a cold day in hell if a women ever becomes president.@ sarcasm eh?     seriously though, biden is inheriting trump's america and trump messed it up big time and you don't fix these problems quickly. i don't think biden has what it takes to fix these issues and i am not a big fan of his vp at all.@ this country is in trouble with this senile old man running it. even worse if his vice president takes over if he can't continue. america will really be in trouble if that happens.@ disgusting, but whatever. smells just as bad as cigarettes, especially if you live in an apartment@ same here@ good citizens , for sure@ was the balancing the flag detour a switchback to season 16?@ not long@ i'm not against it, i just don't want to smell it everywhere i go. i live in an apartment and the last thing i want to deal with is the smell of weed 24/7. i already have to deal with cigarette smoke@ oh great more stoners. like america needs more potheads@ not to spoil things for you in case you haven't watched it yet, but that cast isn't great@ i don't care what anyone says but my favorite candy is \\**circus peanuts\\**@ irritation to the muscles that move the eye?@ season 4 is one of the most unliked seasons of the show. i wouldn't say i agree. i rewatched this season many times, and while it isn't great, it isn't all that terrible either. i'd watch this season before i'd watch season 6 or 20.@ i'd say season 5 is the most revered season of all time amongst many fans, but season 7 is generally well regarded too (i don't personally care for it until some of the later rounds)  season 9 is a mixed bad among many fans. some fans enjoy the dominance of the frat bros and the hippies, while others don't. i think season 9 is one of those seasons that starts strong but gets worse due to the dominance of the two aformentioned teams. of the first 9 seasons, i think 9 is lower mid-pack.  i think fans regard season 1 really well. of the first 9 seasons, only 2 or 3 seasons could lay claim to being better than season 1. i just don't think season 2 is better than season 1.  as for seasons 4 and 6, they're right were they belong. of the first 9 seasons, seasons 4 and 6 are usually at the bottom of most people's rankings. i can totally understand the hate for season 6. the cast was plain awful. as for season 4 , the cast was still bad, but i found myself enjoying it a little more than i did the before. now of course, that doesn't make season 4 any good, but 4 isn't as bad as many make it seem.  i must also stand up for family edition as well. i like the concept. fans clamored for something different and they got it. the route was lackluster, sure. the locations were boring, fine. but the cast was fantastic. the paolos and their constant bickering early on. the weavers and their breakdown along the race. the gaghan family who were just lovable and easily relatable. not really a dud in this cast ( except for the schroeder family, they seemed like pricks). i have , and will not understand the hate this season gets. is it great? no, but it's not bad like so many make it seem.@ mid-pack. i'd compare it to season 12- albeit a lesser version of it. both seasons were very drama free and had an overall likable cast. both seasons are what i call \"feel good\" seasons.  the difference here is that season 12 was the most viewed season of the show's history-even to this day. season 19 is a great too, especially compared to the debacle that was the season 20@ although a total pipe dream, i'd love to see deshaun watson in a steelers uniform. he's a good player for the texans, but i think he could be 10x better if he were on the steelers. the rest of the division is set at the qb spot. burrow, lamar, and mayfield are all franchise qb's and pittsburgh will be in a bad spot when ben retires. and knowing the steelers, i just can't see them tanking to get a good qb.  last year, we say rudolph and hodges, and to be honest, i don't think many of us were very impressed by either of them. darnold and haskins are more of a question mark. it's hard to gauge either because they've played for such bad teams.@ also known as an air embolism, for non-medical folk@ people legit should stop complaining about how ben sucks or butler is terrible. the steelers are 6-0 right now and even if they do lose, they are still tied atop of the division at 6-1 (i think, although i believe baltimore has the better divisional record) alongside the ravens. every team has to take an l at some point ( unless you are the 72 dolphins).     and looking at their upcoming schedule, they have a decent chance of going 15-1 or 14-2. they split the series with baltimore (lose in baltimore but win in pittsburgh). they then play dallas, 2 games against cincinnati, jacksonville, indianapolis, washington, cleveland, and buffalo. assuming they don't have a random fluke loss to jacksonville or washington, at worst, i can see pittsburgh going 14-2 with losses to baltimore and perhaps a loss to cleveland. 14-2 isn't too shabby.@ even then, you have only 5 teams out of a possible 11. i can't really think of any other winners who were major fan favorites, honestly.@ hung and chee are hanging in there in the top half of the field, so i wouldn't be shocked if they won    deangelo and gary could win and i'm surprised they aren't performing better, honestly@ going by favorite winners alone, i wouldn't be able to come up with a list of 11 teams i'd like to see back because i don't like hardly any of the winners, honestly.    call me pessimistic, but from a fan perspective, i could never see an all winners season really working out. none of the winners were really fan favorites except for uchenna and joyce and possibly nat and kat.@ sucks to see jerry and frank be eliminated. fortunately, there remaining teams are really likable@ i hope someone gets double u-turned. i want jerry and frank to survive@ jerry and frank with a crucial mistake~.. yikes@ it amazes me how all the teams forgot to read their clue and bring their groceries.@ these shopping tasks are a blast to watch@ i heard he's being traded to the steelers for cam sutton and a 3rd@ kids shouldn't have sped off in the car. not the cops fault at all. the kids are at fault here because they took off and ran from the cop. good chance if they stayed put, they could've gotten off with just a warning@ it just seemed forced at points. i get being happy and having fun, but they just seemed *too* happy@ underrated teams:  meredith and gretchen- arguably the best older couple ever on the show and nearly made the final 4  paul and ami- had an interesting dynamic. many are put off by paul screaming at ami all the time, but you could tell they truly loved each other. they're married to this day, actually.  duke and lauren- we say their relationship grow over the course of the race. at first, duke was uncomfortable with lauren's sexuality, but by the end of their run, he came to terms with it and it was nice to see. one of the better parent-child teams.    overrated:  flo and zach- flo is one of the most annoying racers ever. she barely did any roadblocks too (i think she did only 1). granted, there have been some worse winners in the series run since, but seeing flo win was a little bittersweet, especially with the other two potential winners. this team was one of the most undeserving teams to ever win.  oswald and danny  team fun@ season 14  season 5  season 31  season 12  season 3@ seeing the yield again is great@ they're better than 95% of other winners. i'd take megan and cheyne over the likes of freddy and kendra/ dave and rachel/ nick and starr/ reichen and chip anyday. i'd rather have likable, but basic winners rather than winners that are absolutely horrible like the aforementioned teams.   megan and cheyne are comparable to kris and jon from season 6. kris and jon just get so much love because they were on a season that had such a miserable cast. put them on any other season and they'd be just like megan and cheyne~.basic@ season 10 had a very unique route and quite possibly had the best cast of all time.     the backhalf of the season brought 10 down. the final 3 of season 10 was more forgettable than actively bad, which is why many don't like it.@ the bransens were better than linzes in my opinion.@ i think the locations themselves in the backhalf of family edition are fine, but i do agree that the \"drive the car to this camp site and get a departure time\" thing was really annoying and caused the season to slow down. the teams were still fun to watch though.@ probably as to avoid spoiling many major touristy places to viewers outside the country.@ i wasn't a fan of the cast. i also believe this season was setup for a ff team to win because the all mm teams were pretty lousy tbh. i don't mind, but i didn't like this season@ because the winners were likable enough compared to season 13@ mika from season 15@ i got it together in college and went on to work in the healthcare field.  my grades weren't *terrible* in high school*.* i wasn't getting d's and f's on a regular basis(never got a f, but i did get 3 d's, 2 in gym class and 1 in ap chemistry), but i was usually getting c's and b's which was just ok.     grades for the most part, play little to no role in how well you do well in your career/life. doing poorly in hs doesn't doom you to a life of failure. as long as you have motivation to do well and move past those awful grades, you can do well in whatever you choose to do in your life.@ season 6 had the disgusting food task where a contestant had to eat some kind of soup and apparently ate their own vomit.  season 8 had an elimination scene that was tough to watch@ i thought the linzes and godlewski's making rude comments about the weavers was despicable but perhaps i'm missing something. were the weavers really bad people or was it bad editing? either way, them making comments about them throughout the latter half of family edition was really uncomfortable to watch.@ \\- billy from the gaghan family is either in or was in the military. last time i heard, carissa was studying microbiology at uconn.  \\- rolly is a cyclist now  \\- a lot of the other siblings such as the linzes and the bransens ended up getting married and had kids    i honestly don't know about anyone else. if you are interested, you can always try to look for their facebook profile to see what they're up to now@ the gaghans elimination was one of the saddest things i've seen on the show. they were likable, rootable, and never engaged in the \"everyone against team florida\" ordeal like almost every other team. the season went downhill after their elimination. i'd so love to see billy and carissa back after 15 years.@ i react with a few different \"actions\" :  \\- i try to mimic the noise  \\- i put in headphones and put on a white noise/fan video(especially if someone is chewing loudly)  \\- i'll occasionally get extremely angry and irritated and perhaps scream at the offending person or thing. i typically regret it later but i still end up doing it every time i hear the offending noise.@ rupert and laura/art and jj were the only real duds in 31. the other teams weren't too bad from my perspective.@ 31 was excellent and had the best cast of the modern seasons. colin and christy winning was amazing.@ likable cast and decent winners. season 31 was a blast and had the best cast of the modern seasons so far. as long as this season has a likable cast and great winners like 31 did, i'm good@ can't wait for the new season. i certainly hope it's not the last season, but i can guarantee it'll be the last season for a long time.@ when you say hello to someone and they ignore you@ not even metv or antenna tv compare because they have all those old people commercials.@ christmas/holiday episodes play on nostalgia. old tv shows were big on the holiday episodes and many people look back on them with fondess@ christmas has a more cozy appeal to me. nothing beats a nice wintry, snowy christmas day curled up on the couch and watching your favorite classic shows or perhaps listening to your favorite classic christmas music.    or maybe you like to go outside and play in the snow or take walks. nothing beats a cold wintry snowy night either. christmas>halloween@ it allows you to transfer to a great state school without having to endure all the hurdles that include sat and gpa scores. work well in community college and you do just fine getting into a great state school@ climate change is killing us slowly but surely. the ice caps are melting and the sea levels are rising. temps are getting hotter and winters are becoming more lukewarm. hurricanes are becoming more and more severe and are happening on a more frequent basis too.     anyone who denies the existence of climate change is delusional@ having a teacher telling you what to do and when to do your assignments can be a benefit to a good many of students. many lack the discipline to learn remotely to the high amount of self-discipline required. there's no teacher telling you what to do when you learn remotely@ halloween is for kids and kids only. any adult who celebrates halloween by dressing up like an idiot needs to grow up and stop acting stupid. you ain't 10 anymore.  halloween is also used as an excuse for kids to go around and extort strangers for free candy and it's ridiculous.@ amazon is like a monopoly when it comes to online shopping , much like how walmart is with in person shopping. since there are less options for people to work , these companies can pay you shit wages and make you work in poor working conditions just because. both of these companies have a terrible reputation of treating many of their employees horribly.     i don't understand how you could you can say these jobs are good for young people@ how does taking the bus involve more walking? besides , a little exercise doesn't hurt anyone.@ where i live(pittsburgh) we have special busway systems that allow buses to bypass heavy traffic areas which is huge plus.@ you have to explore . watch videos , volunteer , watch documentaries ,etc~    i have 3 majors interests : space , nature , and healthcare    i became interested in space because i watched documentaries and read books  my interest in nature started when i started to actually go outside and really take notice of the things many of us take for granted such as plants and the sun  healthcare is the field that i pursued and it was because it was my strongest interest. i've always had an interest in helping people and i'll admit to watching plenty of medical reality shows.    tl;dr : explore a variety of topics and you are bound to find something you like eventually@ it's all in their tone. if they seem to passively say it , then perhaps just laugh it off. however, if they appear serious and deadpan as they say it, you should consider getting them help@ harder majors and classes will generally take up a lot more of your time. stem and healthcare fields are notorious for requiring insane amounts of studying and memorization.     certain classes can be rough as well. chemistry and mathematics often fall under this category. most of us will have to spend a lot of time on these subjects in particular. it just depends on what your major is.@ if you can't understand the assignments after multiple attempts at understanding it , maybe you should reconsider if college is really for you. i know that sounds a tad harsh , but if you aren't understanding something no matter how hard you try , why continue to waste money?@ 2-3 times per day , usually 2 (once every 10 hours)@ avoid all news media if you can@ going outside and getting my hands a little dirty@ white noise@ getting outdoors and enjoying the fresh air and nature. this quarantine has made me realize that i am much much happier outdoors than i am indoors@ there's less toxicity on facebook. post something unpopular on twitter and you have random strangers berating you from a distance because they know they'll be no consequences.    facebook has less of that because since you know most of these people in real life , they'll be less likely to berate you because they know there will be consequences@ my mental health has improved after saying goodbye to twitter. facebook can be toxic at points , but i limit myself to 2-3 a day on facebook@ the statue of liberty is a lot smaller and dirtier than you think@ central park. it's really beautiful and unlike many tourist attractions , central park attracts locals as well@ i find twitter to be a worse offender , which is why i deleted it. so much toxicity on that website and if you said anything remotely unpopular people would berate you endlessly. not to mention all the negative news as well especially in the trending section.     at least with facebook , you don't have nearly as much toxicity as twitter@ i'm brutally honest as well. i tell it like it is and many people just don't like it but i don't care most of the time@ no smoking sections generally don't work , honesetly. cigarette smoke can just travel through the restaurant and next thing you know you are smelling it@ just asking because my uncle , while \"nice\" , has some noticeably toxic traits that really piss me off.@ let them stand in the way. i don't want to smell that garbage as i'd much prefer to smell and breathe in fresh air.@ i just got my recent physical and they kept asking me questions about everything the doctor asked or did and i didn't tell them. why do they need to know how much i weigh and all that? if there were something truly wrong , i would've told them.@ i look good enough. maybe add on an extra pound or two but it's not like i am severely underweight@ they're very persistent with trying to get information out of me. i refuse to tell because it's none of their business.@ i'm of average weight for my age, perhaps slightly below@ i dropped a monster shit in the toilet and it smelled bad. then of course , people have to walk

rain  6. some like it hot  5. the birds  4. splendor in the grass  3. rear window  2. the graduate  1. breakfast at tiffany's@ the cinematography. there are other classic movies i'd watch before citizen kane , but it is unquestionably a classic@ he and the crew could do a cross-country deal where they buy an rv and drive around to various haunted east coast locations , so i don't think it's about flying@ i'd argue season 15's first leg is the worst , but that's a different story.    but i do agree about family edition losing momentum when they hit the southwest. i feel the first 5 or so episodes are excellent television , but it begins to drag after episode 6. the episodes aren't terrible per se , but they're far from enjoyable. i do enjoy the paolo , bransen , and godlewski families so at least they made the back of the season somewhat more watchable@ season 2 has aged poorly. season 1 and season 3 are significant in there unique ways. as for why season 2 was awful , much of it comes down to casting and the locations. the locations feel like a retread of season 1. the cast also seemed very similar to the first season.   t&w= frank and margurita  gary and dave= kevin and drew  chris and alex= rob and brennan   so forth    season 2 for me has not stood the test of time.@ seasons 2 , 6 , 13 , and 20 were all worse seasons in my opinon.@ you have a point. however , family edition , despite its flaws , is much better than season 2, 6 , and 20.@ masturbated in the open without telling anyone@ the media perpetuates the negativity. 95% of what you see in the news is negative stuff. i'd consider myself an optimistic realist. i love to have positive vibes , but i also keep things realistic. i'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right@ endgame was crap to begin with. this solidifies the fact this new movie will be even worse. audiences today take this drivel and eat it up@ maybe you shouldn't have gone in the first place? maybe it's not school , maybe you just don't enjoy college in general@ for my classes , i study for maybe an hour or two each day , not including reading any text or homework. in an average week , i usually spend no more than 50 hours studying@ labs are pretty terrible. you have two options. if you are far into your major , toughing it out might be your best bet. if you just started , however, you may want to find another major. just beware that some degrees require a chemistry class with a lab such as many medical field jobs@ when people reference nothing existed before the beginning , they most likely are talking about the philosophical version of absolute nothing where there literally is nothing , which is impossible to grasp. empty space , on the otherhand , technically contains small particles which renders it is as something.  i imagine if there were other universes , they'd be like bubbles and they'd be so far away from each other , the distance would be insurmountable. therefore , any big bang that would happen would have no effect on other universes.    each universe contains their own space. all the hypothetical universes , however , would exist in something called \"hyperspace\" , which itself  , is infinite@ everything is farther away than it looks so the likelihood of getting by a rogue planet or star  is not likely. however , there is a good chance the earth would get flung out of

(2) after graduating you work to get a 1-year work visa with your f1 student visa which can be extended for another 2 years if you have a stem degree. so in total, you can work for 3 years in america, even if you don't get an h1b.  (3) multinational companies move employees to a different nation like the uk, canada if there are any visa issues. if you work abroad for a year, you can come back on an l1 visa.  (4) most tech companies will file a green card application for you, after your first year. there are three stages for the employment-based green card application. once the second stage is complete which takes roughly 1.5 to 2 years, you can keep renewing your h1b infinitely till you get a green card. for indians, there is a 100 year+ waiting time to get a green card.  (5) i have seen people who have just a bachelor's degree from shitty third-tier colleges like mody institute of technology or the army institute of technology in pune get a job in google bangalore as a software engineer after working in india for 3 to 4 years. spend some time reading through the discussion forum on leetcode and you can see this for yourself.  (6) education, money, job are three separate things. they are dependent on each other, but not as closely dependent as you are imagining.  (7) people who spend 40 lakhs on a master's degree do it purely for the sake of education. you need to stop thinking that you are buying a visa for 40 lakhs. that's not what that 40 lakhs fee is for.@ there are a few things i think are worth pointing here.  (1) making a lot of money and getting an education are two separate goals.   (2) going into 50k debt to get a master's degree, for me personally, was a wrong decision, unquestionably.   (3) i did not entirely grasp what grad school meant when i was applying for a master's program in 2014. they don't teach you fundamentals of anything in grad school, unless you have a firm grasp over your fundamentals, you are not going to get your money's worth out of a grad school.   (4) there are some really awesome jobs that a grad school degree can unlock for you, only if you are really passionate about a subarea of your field of study and only if you spend your time in grad school productively. these jobs unquestionably pay ridiculously well. i am talking about 600k to 700k total compensation a year.   (5) if you are from a middle-class family like me, the fact that you are 50k in debt is going to force you into pouring all of your energy into getting a job first, then whatever free time you are left with, you will end up spending that on your college studies. this will result in you getting a mediocre gpa. no professor will write you a letter of recommendation. you will have a piece of paper saying that you have a master's degree but that's about it.   (6) don't signup for an ms program unless you are genuinely interested in the subject. the two years i spent acquiring the ms degree was extremely stressful for me, entirely because i did not have the aptitude for it.  a better way to come to the us would be to get a master's degree from a reputed college in india, then apply for a ph.d., which is almost free. by the time you are 40 or 50, you would have more than adequately recovered the wages you lost in the 4 to 5 years you spent on getting your ph.d. also, you will be working on much better projects than your peers who stopped after just getting a master's degree. at the same time, if you realize you don't have an aptitude for grad school, you can stop after a master's. i promise you, if you get a master's from iit or iisc, you will definitely get an opportunity to work outside of india and earn a crap ton of money :) also, most of the people(50%) who get a ph.d. from a top 50 college in america end up interning at facebook or google.  also, if you don't want to get another degree at all. you can always try to work for an american company in india that will eventually transfer you to their american/london/canadian office. the compensation and living standards will certainly be better than in india.@ i came to the us in 2015 to get an ms degree in cs. i had an internship at a famous bank in 2016 summer where i was paid 18,000$. i also got a return offer from them. the following semester i got a better offer from a faang like company but not faang, so i reneged on the bank's offer and joined the other firm.  the whole of first year of the ms program i had a minimum wage job which was barely enough to pay my house rent. second-year, i got a ta position which covered most of my living expenses.  my parents paid my college fees and most of my living expenses in the first year. i was able to pay them back everything they spent within the first six to eight months of joining the job. i also took a car loan during the first six months, which i managed to pay off in that period as well. all in all, i was debt-free, after the first 9 months, including any money i borrowed from friends, on credit cards, etc.  in total, tuition was around 40,000$ living expenses were around 600 \\~ 650$ a month.  so i would say, it costed my parents around 50,000$ \\~ 52,000$ roughly including application fees, gres, flight tickets, and all. also, my car costed me 23,000$  also, my current net worth is somewhere between 270k \\~ 280k, today. i am 28 years old, will turn 29 in december.@ that's how you beat your meat.@ 9 out of 10 dentists want to fuck you.@ @ the bird noises that mumble rappers make like \"brrr\", \"skrrrr\"@ doesn't look like the guy who runs over homeless people sleeping on sidewalks or the guy who shoots blackbucks or the guy who acts in cheesy, over-the-top action movies at all.@ turn that frown upside down.   and i will gladly ride your ass, all night long!@ to think that someone looked at this fucker and thought of domesticating it several thousand years ago, is amazing.@ that shit looks like the ugliest pair of teeth, i have ever seen.@ what good is a man without a full set of teeth in his mouth?@ i think smoking spoils your teeth.@ pspspspspsps, here kitty kitty kitty.@ i bet these two don't even brush their teeth.@ she looks like she brushes her teeth daily.@ i wonder what toothpaste she uses to clean her teeth.@ i mean.. no homeless guy has ever peed in my car while making steady eye contact with me. so~~.@ wrote this comment and went to bed. woke up to nearly 50+ notifications on my phone and 850 likes on this comment!

if i would have not wasted the whole of last week maybe i could have done it too.   tomorrow if someone would have gotten into the university of minnesota for a ph.d i will be like damn, i should have focussed on that course that i was auditing. i feel like no matter what i do, i will not be happy.  this rare moment of wisdom, where i have this epiphany into my life doesn't last very long.@ he probably has grey hair now.@ jack black, is that you?@ thanks. this is something i didn't think about before!@ i mean, at least they believe in mars.@ well, i did not mean, that i will approach a professor who i have never met before. the college where i got my masters from is also, about an hour away from where i currently live. i was planning on approaching a professor in my college under whom i actually took a course.  i mean, i can try to wing it solo, but working with a professor might be a lot more convenient.@ can i approach a professor and ask to work on a paper with him? i cannot publish a paper on my own and i think i need a professor's help.@ i see.@ i am okay with not getting coverage from my insurance company. i've mostly decided to not make a claim for this. i have the money to get it fixed by myself. i was wondering if i would get into legal trouble with the cops or something for not reporting this. nobody was harmed nor did i damage anyone's property other than mine.\n",
      "wrong sub. probably.@ there's been a lot of high quality stuff posted on this sub lately.     but this is the low quality shit we deserve (and love).@ will this make us all \"investors\"?@ wait what sub did i click on?@ i went in the middle; got a little cheap ipad that i can have around work and use my trading programs in a browser.@ holy crap there are 4,600 people still buying 270p 11/6!@ \\*in lotr voice\\*    \"what about second dip?\"  real talk baba is always a fun one to sell cause the premiums always seem good. way more cost effective than buying.@ uh, for what?

then i'll show you my charts.  otherwise, nah. fuck off you little autist.@ see my response to the autist.  if you have a $10k account, then putting up $3k a week is still 30% of your total account. most traders will say not to use that much, but it works well enough for me. its only \"risky\" in the collateral itself, but at .2 delta or less, you have to have a huge market swing to break the strike. so don't do this during earnings.  edit: i'm not saying take this trade, but if you want to see what i'm talking about: open your broker, go to apple, set the expiration for nov 6, put in a call credit spread for 113/114, and you'll get a $27 credit and have to put up $100 of collateral.   $100 x 30 = $3,000   $27 x 30 = $810  i wouldn't yolo it if you've only got $3k but this is fairly easy to pull off on a variety of stocks. you still need to place the right spreads at the right times. i'm just using this as a quick example to show what i'm talking about.@ its pretty easy. you think you can't make $600 off just $3,000 every week? here is a basic math example:  you set up credit spreads at a .20 delta. you get $100 in credit, but have to put up $500 in collateral. you do this 6 times. you now have made $600 in credit, and put up $3,000 in capital.  you set them up on tuesday to expire friday. as long as the market doesn't make a big move past your strike, the spread expires and you keep your credit.  that's $600 in one week. do that four weeks in a row? $2400.  now you need to pull back some on your autism. i get this place is a haven for people like you but when the adults are talking, you need to know your place and go back to the kids table.@ give yourself a tug you can afford it@ /friday   time to waste money on something else, i guess.  does draftkings have commissions?   /s@ you can make about $600 a week off $3,000 doing 20 delta credit spreads. $2400 a month.  guessing you've got a cash chunk already sitting there for either collateral or just cash covering the puts.@ don't worry, round 2 of rona will make your cruise puts work still  (as long as they expire in december)@ ya but that ain't gonna be next week@ i get this place is a haven for autism but its really sad you had to explain this to people.@ mods asleep, post nonsense@ try turning your screen over@ your fault for buying 10 shares of hertz tbh@ i also accidentally bought 1 million shares of apple and 1 million share of tesla and now i need financial advice from reddit on stocks.     you know this is 100% true because i won't post screenshots and i wrote it on the internet, so you all have to believe me.@ always inverse wsb@ that's a kinda standard opinion, tbh@ the poor rh younglings~@ who needs retirement tendies when you can have that sweet, sweet reddit karma?@ why does he have a chunk of the moon around his feet?@ i noticed this with the reits going opposite of the tech stocks, too.     its neat to meet a fellow autistic jedi.@ theta is a bitch@ always inverse wsb?

      "nta.  you're making a smart decision. this is a terrible idea and no one should be financing it.@ piercings shouldn't be on genitals and this is the reason why@ good luck, dude.@ start talking to someone about your issues - a close friend, a family member, a counsellor ideally. it's easier to understand your feelings when you have to voice them. even discussing this issue with your boyfriend may help you re-evaluate your perspective.  also, keep in mind that you're 20 and practically no one has their life together at 20. your boyfriend probably has insecurities about his work or other parts of his life that he hasn't shared with you. putting him on a pedestal like this is dangerous thinking and will hurt your relationship.   plus, trying to compare nursing to electrical work is like comparing a bee to a donut. they're just not the same thing and each come with their challenges. recognising that you experience a lot of self-doubt and low self-esteem is a good step but you need to start correcting how you talk about yourself and recognising your achievements. for a while, i would journal every so often and write down things that i liked about myself and that i did well.   you're a good person who deserves to feel valued and loved. good luck.@ it sounds like she's interested. maybe do an overt romantic gesture like bringing her flowers or something like that. that would be a good way to figure out whether or not she's keen for a proper relationship without having to ask.@ nta.  nothing about this relationship seems like it's going to work out. especially the fact that he's been through similar circumstances before and he hasn't stepped up to be a father. i'd consider getting out@ nta. your mum is being super inconsiderate and doesn't realise there's consequences to her actions. is your fiancee okay?@ noise complaints usually have to be after around 10 - 11pm.   technically nta but holy shit, you mow a lot. keep in mind that your neighbour is probably just frustrated with the constant noise.@ as someone with a big family, sometimes you just have to do the hard stuff so that you can avoid passive-aggressive bullshit later. you wouldn't be at fault for not going but sometimes it's about knowing which battles are worth fighting and which aren't.   good luck on your wedding!@ nah.   they're cute little kids, dude. of course your family is going to want to fawn over them - it's what happens when there's cute little kids around. i get that it sucks though because you don't have any cousins your own age who you can spend time with and you're basically in that awkward position of being too young to interact meaningfully with the rest of your family.   go apologise to your grandma and be open about your feelings. try and make an effort to be a good older cousin.@ nah.  i would talk to your niece and her mother about your concerns before you make any big decisions. is it just the fact the niece's wedding is so far away?@ you need to be upfront about how uncomfortable you are and how you feel like she doesn't trust you and you need to start putting up boundaries. you will also want to discuss whether or not she has a history of being cheated on to find out where these fears are coming from - be assertive but not rude.@ tell him to knock it off. if she's made her feelings known, then he's just going to make her uncomfortable.@ i was like this when i first started dating. talking about these feelings with your partner really does help you deal with them and makes them feel less overwhelming. i'd also recommend professional help if you have access to it - it really helped with my social anxiety.@ you should absolutely start talking to someone about these issues because there's no way you can deal with them by yourself. if not your boyfriend, maybe a counsellor or even your family if you're comfortable? it sounds like you might be dealing with depression.  you also need to start taking steps to finding more things in your life that make you happy. hobbies, friends, anything that makes you feel like you have agency in your own life again. have you thought about reconnecting with old school friends?@ you're being gaslit. you might want to go stay with a friend or your parents whilst you try and get this sorted out. there's a lot of red flags in your relationship.@ i had a similar problem when i broke up with my girlfriend in that i really liked and respected her but just didn't feel comfortable being in a romantic relationship with her.   you've got to do it sooner rather than later, in person, and make it very clear exactly why you're breaking up with him. you're going to be at least somewhat guilty (it comes with the territory) but the relief will be enormous once you've finally done it. you'll also want to give him some space for at least a few weeks because at that point, you don't get to control how he feels about you and you need to accept that.   whilst you may want to notify his family or a friend after you've done it (maybe through a text or something to let them know that they may want to keep an eye on him), ultimately you aren't responsible for his mental health. plus, it would be super damaging to your relationship with him if he found out that you were only staying because you felt trapped.   good luck and take care of yourself during this difficult time.@ jesus. i think for starters, you need to get a lawyer involved because it sounds like it's just going to get worse and you don't want to lose such a valuable asset. you definitely shouldn't let adam live with you either.  your sister sounds like a crap person. were things this bad when you bought the house together?@ i'm really glad you've got this relationship with your daughter where you can discuss this. i think you've made a sensible decision and it means that you won't ever have to deal with the awkward situation of your daughter resorting to using something more unorthodox to get the job done. my mum worked in the er for a while and there were always some weird stories.  good on you for teaching your daughter sex positivity!@ god this is a shit show.  don't feel obliged to stay for the sake of the child but don't go out of your way to expose her to your church. despite her screw-up, she's going to be very vulnerable going forward and you cutting her off from her support network is not a kind move.@ yta. your son clearly has something medically wrong with him. why are you even trying to frame this like he's at fault for this?@ nta.  you never agreed to give it to her. plain and simple.@ nah.  i can see why your daughter is upset but considering there is nothing you can do about all the years where the issue wasn't fixed and you've now had the situation rectified, she needs to let it go. don't be dismissive of her anxieties though.@ nta.  as someone majoring in animal science, i think this is a very responsible decision. your mom has a very weird idea on how keeping a pet should work in that she's using it as a teaching tool but isn't actually allowing you to properly take care of it by allowing it to exercise or interact with you outside of the cage. also, the whole idea of getting someone a pet without telling them is always a bad idea.   good on you for prioritising your rabbit's well-being. good luck in convincing your mum to let you rehome it.@ a grown man has been intimidating and bullying you for years - why the fuck does your dad want to hang out with this guy? he sounds like a tool.   nta. it sucks that your dad isn't taking this seriously enough. caring for you your whole life is his obligation as a parent, but he should be standing up for you no matter what because he cares about you and he loves you.@ i think you did a really good job with the email. it's very well-written and does a perfect job of criticising their behaviour without making it seem too harsh and gives them the benefit of the doubt should they just be getting too overly anxious.   just do your best to uphold the boundaries you put out in the email and regardless of what happens going forward, i think you might want to consider re-evaluating your relationship with your sister and brother in law. if they're being this disrespectful now, i have to wonder what it's going to be like during childbirth/after the pregnancy. have you discussed with them what is going to happen after childbirth?@ honestly, if a dude isn't going to shave his own pubes, then he shouldn't be asking a girl to do the same.  plus, it's weird that it took him months to just say he didn't like it. good on you for ditching him since he's probably going to be passive aggressive about other shit too@ i love the tiny little shark next to its fin <3\n",
      " banned, you won't be; criticism is what any movement needs.  unlike the civil rights movement of the 60s, there are no strong leaders. not that \"strong leaders\" are needed, but a healthy direction is.    it is easy to kill a peaceful movement with violence. in the 70s, i have personal experience being a marshall (peace-keeper) in our massive demonstrations. we kept them peaceful by directly stopping the agitators. that seems to be an essential missing factor here.     unlike back then, today, people are armed at demonstrations, this makes for more deadly situations, and the police are not deterring it.   what is needed now are people trained and initiated as warriors.  warriors are not police or military; the training is more intensive. the primary difference is that the police slogan is serving and protecting, whereas the warrior slogan is serving, protecting, and sacrificing. warriors do not have fear, so they can deal with situations that law enforcement can't because we are not afraid of dying.  remember, police are primarily there to protect property, not people!  racism of all kinds is real, and this needs to be stopped, but not with violence, that is counterproductive!@ > antifa  sorry about my slow response, i'm not really on the internet much. al-qaeda is a poor example; they where created by the cia to fight russia and turned against us. they are well organized and have a chain of command.  what i'm trying to do here is merely clarify, not argue; i'm just stating what our intelligence agencies know. now you may be right if you say antifa is a movement, a movement that started after ww2 for apparent reasons.    now i'm going to address the real issue; people who claim to be anti-fascist and use violence to stop violence is counterproductive. they turn popular opinion against them and give more attention to the fascist organizations. furthermore, many people claiming to be anti-fascist and use violence to express their opposition are acting out from their disturbing emotional and psychological state. they are not acting from a place of altruism. this non-altruism is not valid for all; some are just misguided.    i have not found any direct evidence that the anti-fascist movement is responsible for the riots. there is lots of evidence showing that right-wing extremist groups and organizations are. think about it logically, if you want to stop a peaceful movement for equal rights, turn it violent. again it is the general public opinion that will make things change, not a small minority.   i am anti-fascist as i would hope that a lot of people are here. most of us do not want our rights taken away. we want our rights to do what i'm doing right here, speaking the truth as i see it and know it, fully knowing i'm going to get a lot of negative points for it. all the same, if i get just a few people thinking beyond the programming they're fed, it is worth the negative points (bad karma).  we want our first amendment rights, we want our second amendment rights, along with all the others, fascism will take that away from us, don't let it happen!@ the problem here is not whether it is a group or not; it is how easy it is to turn public opinion by lying. without any evidence, most people here are fooled so easily by a lie, a dangerous lie that will help create a civil war.  free thinking takes a lot of work; it means you need to look beyond the words. a lot more work than merely believing someone who fools you into thinking you're on the same side, so they must be telling the truth.  you are being lied to; you do have the power to look beyond the words, really you can, don't be so lazy.@ antifa is merely short for \"anti-fascists.\" people may organize into \"groups\" that are anti-fascists, and the group may say anti-fascists or antifa in its name; however, there is no organization called antifa. there are no leaders or chapters; there is nothing to identify \"antifa\" as an organization. it is an ideology that is aggressively against fascists.   you may have a good argument that the aggressive anti-fascists are taking away the 1st amendment rights of fascists, and you'd be right. at least they are trying to take away the rights of people who will take away all our rights; the 1st amendment, 2nd amendment, you name it, they'll take it. you do know what fascism is.   i can come up with many of these,  but what's the point, deeply rooted biases are impossible to uproot;       the real problem is how easy it is to distract people and keep us enslaved. liars are running this country, they have run the country, and they will continue to run this country and the world down, as the masters have a big laugh, as the rest of us starve.    i don't care who is in office; they are all from the same class, a \"class\" that most of us don't belong too. they will keep us, slaves, fighting each other as long as possible, while the \"ruling class\" is the only one benefiting from the system they created!@ there is no group, repeat; \"there is no group! that's why the fbi cannot do what trump demands.      the \"umbrella man,\" who is the best-documented rioter, was a member of a right-wing group.  many of the riots, not all, were done by a right-wing extremist. they were \"done\" to turn public opinion against the struggle for equal rights, and effectively did so, furthermore; some are trying to encourage a race war.        it is interesting how people born on the same planet are in different worlds. you \"obviously\" only get your news from government-controlled fox; the rest of the world will tell you a very different story.@ how is an ideology declared a terrorist group?  does that mean that everyone against \"fascism\" will be labeled a \"terrorist?\" does that also mean being pro-fascist or fascist is ok? and all of our family members who died in ww2 died for a worthless course?@ not so much hatred as perhaps pitty.  when you get down to it, our modern world thrives on death and killing, we lost our way and understanding of how to take care of a sustainable and living planet, and in that there is a great sadness. naive people who still live in traditional ways feel sorrow for us because we forgot how to live, and for the most part, walk around like the \"living dead.\"  we no neither death nor life because we live in an out of balance world!@ it's a matter of priority. if you have a close family, brother, they will be friends for life, always connected, always there when you need them. others will not be, they'll come and go, obviously keep your brother, and if your friend cannot get over it, he's not a real friend, he's a \"control freak,\" you don't need him, nor does your brother.@ naive people were and still are (in remote places) not born into a world like ours that is \"laced with a multitude of deceptions.\" they were not born into a culture where the majority have given into the programming that makes you a brainless zombie.  they were born into life, as it was meant to be and did not need to question reality.  they understood intuitively that life and death are the same, that everything is \"interconnected\" as one great spirit, and were not confused as people born into our current world of lies. it's that simple!@ cute, but if you live in the wilds year-round, it is useless; you always know how much light you'll have left, intuitively without having to hold up your hand.@ it's all very simple, we are all slaves and the masters like to encourage us slaves to fight each other so, we'll remain slaves.  oh, the rich are not the masters, they are just overseers (slaves with a little bit of power), the real masters are hidding in plain sight!@ yes, he is setting it up, so if he loses, he will have a lengthy court battle. if he loses the \"court battle, he'll start a civil war. everything is in play; however, there is also a possibility that he will be \"assassinated,\" as it is equally possible that biden may get an unexpected heart-attack.  whatever happens, one thing is for sure; this will be far from an ordinary election!

lol@ nice, i guess i'm trying to do the same. i like how you say **\"homo sapien\"** instead of  **\"human.\"**  words have more profound meaning and influence than the apparent. i prefer to call myself a **\"caretaker\"** instead of a human.@ love and sex are complicated issues, and although i can go on and on about how love flows and changes, i won't, give you abvice you don't want to hear.     i'll merely suggest  \"mulondo.\" it is an african herb that will keep him hard and excited. some herbs can be \"used to increase\" his size as well. also, consider doing tantric yoga and practicing sexual magic; they can open up other realms of sexuality.        good luck!@ although the pattern does fit the general psychological profile, it is not universal. there are many people on both sides with good hearts and good intentions as there are people on both sides whose hearts are \"poisoned\" with hate and fear.  there is no doubt in my mind, whether or not there is an assassination attempt or success,  around the time of the elections, a \"race war\" will start, that will turn into a \"civil war\" with many different factions fighting each other and the government.  this \"civil war\" will happen, unless the very unlikelihood that we come together, all people of all nations and beliefs, and see beyond these meaningless differences. that we collectively, as a species, understand that we are just one living planet; we acknowledge that fact and work to keep it alive!@ love has many forms, including \"benevolence;\" love merely is giving and caring when you get down to it. the word \"love\" is worthless; the practice is priceless!@ fantastic, it appears you have come to the awareness of the one heart!@ you're someone who has no real idea of what it means to be a warrior.   you think i have not been in a violent situation; you're really off base. i'm not hiding; you can see my name, when you find the things i do and did, you won't make such a dumb-ass assumption!  i'm not at this point assuming anything about you. just one thing i know, and i'm not \"assuming,\" i know it for a fact by what you wrote, you're not even close to being a warrior. you're not a native; you are not from any warrior tradition; you have not been \"initiated,\" you're far from understanding the very importance and relevance of the spiritual with a warrior's life. i'm not assuming it is evident in your writing.  warriors are not war-lords; not mercenaries, we are not \"centered\" on killing. the first obligation of a warrior is to be of service, the second is to protect, and the third is to sacrifice. these three are universal; however, as enlightened warriors, e.g., buddha, jesus, muhammad made us aware of their teachings of how to serve better; generosity and hospitality were \"added.\"@ it would help if you did a more in-depth study of the mayans than what the media gives you to \"work with.\" while you're at it, look into trend-science, and try to understand how they correlate. the mayan predictions are much more complicated than merely giving a date at the end of one calendar.@ hey dumbass, do you see how worthless your insults are. you are a very powerless person, weak in every way. oh, you just read the last paragraph and this one, what is that saying about you?@ it looks like you like to give abuse. i guess it is what you are use too. your childhood problems will not go away on their own. if you work on it, that can help, first you need to accept what happened to you. i know people just tolerate you, no one really likes you. you still did not look me up yet, i'm not hiding, i'm well known. i can help you, but i won't you're not worth saving, you'll die with this dying world, the new world has no place for you. you're missing one of the big keys for you to move on, do you know what that is?@ you are insulting, childish, and i know this, and your weight problem comes from the abuse you had in childhood, as is your feeling of inferiority, needing to be a bully, and putting others down. no, as long as you're giving me shit, i will not \"fuck off,\" and i'd tell you that to your face.   whatever you give me, i'll give it to you back a few times more.   you cannot hurt an old warrior; i have been through it all; there is nothing new you can do.   on the other hand, if you work on healing yourself and loving yourself, you will not need to put others down; i encourage you to do that, and stop trying to attack me because you'll only lose!     oh, giving a \" blowjob to a chainsaw \" is a really bad idea!@ > conspiracy theorist   >   >conspiracy theorist  again, i know you'll hate to do it because it will show you someone very different from assuming who or what i am, google my name. you'll find this is not my first time on the internet.     a \"conspiracy theorist\" would need a \"conspiracy,\" now, if you were intelligent enough to have an intelligent conversation instead of making childish remarks, you would benefit from what you would learn from me and be \"prepared\" for what is coming!@ out of 195,000 people in this community, there must be at least one person who understands more than what the media told them to believe. the misleading fear-mongering propaganda, unless it is the general attitude of a prepper, to be easily misled by their deep-rooted fear, not understanding the true nature of life and death or the endless natural cycles.  the most significant misunderstanding is the wisdom of many tribes that it is not and never has been about the end of the world; instead, it is about creating a new world. so you seriously missed the point.@ no, people, i \"personally,\" think preppers are crazy because they are blind, see what is in it for themselves, don't see the big picture, and are some of the most powerless and fearful people i have ever met!@ not to repeat \"myself,\" look at the other post.@ you foolishly think the end of the calendar means the end of life on earth. no, it does not, yes the world as you know it, is dying, as a new world is being born. that is way too much for you to understand i'm sure!@ fear seems to be the main reason a prepper is a prepper, so full of doubt they won't know the truth when they see it!@ believe it or not, the internet will not give you everything you need, and to find the truth, you need to do a lot more research offline than online!@ not at all, just someone who was hoping to share information with well-educated people, who are \"apparently\" not here!@ somehow i survived the last 65, had more fights than i can count, came back from the dead twice, saved more lives than at my old age i can remember, and still having to deal with lots of idiots that think 33 years of living a fearful experience means you know life!@ no, don't worry, be happy lol. we'll only have minor problems, you know like super storms, civil war, a super solar flare (2021-23), a couple of major earthquakes, a few volcanic eruptions, all minor, but set your calendar for 2033. after then, you'll have something to \"worry about!\"@ if you take the time and study what people held as important enough to pass on to other worlds, you may learn that you have more control over reality then you realize.@ no, preppers are crazy because their minds are closed, and their \"hearts are laced\" with fear! i'm not a prepper, i know what i am, and to tell you will bring more of the same kind of remarks i got in this post. so for my amusement, i'll let you know; i'm a warrior! have fun with that one!@ what about the next few decades? and what about the fact that everything that has happened was known before they happened?@ what's this \"kool aid\" thing? are you referring to jonestown? i don't even like kool aid or any other junk food, so i don't get it, to be honest.@ read about what i did at standing rock; you may enjoy the story. i do not live a western lifestyle; the way i live, if you were to try it, you would have been dead a long time ago. you can find my proof if you do a google search.   i'm an honorary member of two tribes, been involved in native struggles since wounded knee way back in the 70s. would you like to come and point a gun in my face and see who will walk away?@ do a google search on my name. look at where i live when i'm not on a mission, and maybe you'll have a better idea of who or even what you're writing about. don't make such foolish assumptions. you know what assuming does don't you?@ gee, i don't know what to say about this \"one.\" its logic is well beyond me!@ veganism of long ago was \"not connected\" to helping the healing of our planet. it was \"just focused\" on our health and the abuse of other species. however, now that more and more people are making an environmental connection, which is a significant threat to the \"slaughter-industry,\" they feel a need to play on the cultural and hereditary habit of eating flesh, manipulating the opinion of their patrons, and continuing to profit from killing!@ very good; i'll leave this post up to give more people a chance to express themselves. i'm surprised that no one googled my name yet. i'm not hiding; that's my real name and picture.@ i'm going to be very direct, very straight to the point! yes, and no, it is not the early stages. it is midway! we are close to a race-war that will turn into a civil war.  get real there has already been killing; all the signs are there. understand the usa is \"heavily-armed,\" with 110 guns for every 100 people, and anger has been deeply rooted, ever since the oppressed has been uprising and resisting.  if you know how to follow trends, you can see this and understand where it is going!  the question is, what are sane caring people of reasonable intelligence going to do about it?  how bad this war develops is up to us collectively; the \"war\" will happen because it is happening, and there is nothing anyone can do to head it off!@ although i have given survival classes, even classes in the warrior arts to people that call themselves preppers, i don't think i'm one of you. i'm one of those people you can drop anywhere, and i'll survive just by understanding the oneness of life at a spiritual level. i have \"knowledge\" i foolishly thought people here would appreciate, apparently not.  i also prefer to educate people, face to face; they are not so disrespectful and close-minded.  i don't need any of you, and you don't need me, good luck, i know for a fact, just by your attitude, most of you will not survive!@ dude, tell me more about what a prepper's life style is? and just for the record, i don't drink \"kool aid!\"@ gee, i guess i read this \"reddit\" wrong. to clarify, perhaps foolishly. i don't think anyone here will understand, from the negative feedback i got so far, but i'll give it a try just because it's my purpose in life lol.  there is new science and old. the \"new\" knows about things like solar cycles, the changing of the seasons, etc. the \"old\" had tried to pass something down from worlds long forgotten, in a way that they hope people would understand.  there are long cycles that are related to cosmic events that new science does not know about yet.  the problem here is that most people seem to have been taken-in by the sensationalism around 2012. the drive for some people to make money off of the end of the \"long count mayan calendar\" without understanding the culture and that their science is much more complex and advance than a lot of people understand.  the short count calendar is where the prediction comes from,  not the \"long count,\" and if any of you read it, you know it is right on.  people asked me before 2012 if the world is going to end, and i said the mayans did not say that, and i told them further watch out for 2020 to 2053, that is when things will heat up.  now i don't only know what will happen; i know how to survive it, and i foolishly thought that people interested in prepping would want to know.  so the question is, is there anyone interested in being proactive to assure the survival of our species and life on earth, or are you just interested in your survival and getting by day-to-day?@ almost no teenager is respected, that comes from no child being \"respected,\" this is the core problem with our modern patriarchal and puritanical world, and this lack of respect comes from the nature of ownership. people \"actually\" think they own each other; this false perception leads to many psychological problems.  the emotional affects the psychological, which in turn affects the physical. your problems are interrelated, and they come from the lack of respect that your father has shown you and given you for all your 18 years of life. you know what is right for you, even if he does not!  you need to work on healing and loving your internal hurt child and return it to the original blissful child that it was at birth. you are young, and you have the world before you; if you do this at this time, as you mature into \"advanced adulthood\\*,\" you will come to your power, and it will show on the smile on your face!  a simple thing you can do to affirm your \"love of self\" would be to take a teaspoon of honey every morning, do it as a ritual, confirming that you are taking care of yourself. within a couple of months, you'll notice you'll have less pain ( cramps ); within a year, it will be \"gone!\"  \\*\"advanced adulthood;\" you are currently an \"adult,\" although you are not respected as such!@ remember this, when you go in; you won't come out the same. if you're just doing it for fun, you're wasting your time. every one of these medicines has a particular spirit. they are masculine, feminine, and twin-spirit and each has something unique to teach. if you want to get the most out of it, do a ritual with an intent!@ the \"woods\" are doing fine, still producing an abundance of food!  all the same, the stores are going to have less and less, food shortage is an ongoing and growing problem!@ lol, i guess if you like bullies :d  you're right, he won't, he needs \"generals,\" and they don't like him, the best he could do is use \"q\" as his version of the  \"brown coats.\" and then there are factors that he has no control over. over the next 13 years, each of these upcoming years will present challenges that no one will be able to have absolute control over. the following 20 years will be impossible for anyone who does not understand the \"power of love\" to survive!@ lol, i guess if you like bullies :d        you're right, he won't, he needs \"generals,\" and they don't like him, the best he could do is use \"q\" as his version of the  \"brown coats.\" and then there are factors that he has no control over. over the next 13 years, each of these upcoming years will present challenges that no one will be able to have absolute control over. the following 20 years will be impossible for anyone who does not understand the \"power of love\" to survive!@ so much hypocrisy!        what i find really funny or maybe disgusting, are people who eat pigs but get disgusted with cannibals, when if they were \"fed\" a human and told it was a pig, they would not know the difference and may even say it was the best \"pig\" they ever ate.         there is no real difference between our flesh and that of other animals!@ *din* is a traditionalist name, the name the people called themselves, and what traditionalist still use as their name.  to be clear, *din* is what they were \"called\" before the derogatory term \"navajo.\" \"navajo\" was initially given to them from the spanish, \"who\" were trying to steal their homeland. although the definition has changed over the years, it originally meant \"throat cutter.\"@ skinwalker is of the dine and is \"not\" usually talked about with outsiders. some things are best left in their traditions of origin, we have all seen what some people have done with things freely given.  all the same, it sounds like you have ptsd, i hope you are getting help for that in one form or another! be well.@ i agree, however, children are growing up in a world built on abuse, every aspect of this out of balance world is abusive. last year i did 13 vision quests, mostly to find out how we can survive these current times and the much harder ones that are on their way.         i did warrior sweat huts, fasting, physical exhaustion, along with mdma, lsd, lsa, and shrooms, alone and at times in combination. i did not only go to other realms; i did time travel as well. oh, i do not recomend this to others to do, unless you're of the warrior path and are not affaid of dying.        what i learned was that children were not only cared for; they were \"worshipped,\" respected, and allowed to be themselves.  not only were they not abused, but their authentic selves were also \"maintained\" throughout adulthood.@ yes, i agree; however, it is also correct that you do not have control over the \"initial feeling\" that happens without you having consistent control over your immediate awareness. after the \"feelings\" happen, you can then control where it goes.       i firmly believe that we who do a lot of tripping should also do a lot of meditating so that we'll have a little more control or at least negotiated control while journeying. you always want the flow to happen, however, if ego death does not occur, you will not go as deep, and that is where control can help!@ lol :d that's true too!@ powerful shrooms, \"golden teacher\" is another name.@ good point!@ the sacred medicines are powerful. i have been using them for more than 50 years, and i find they are all different. salvia gave me the most challenging experience, whereas a mix of shrooms and mdma gave me my most comfortable. they were all very healing, and i have nothing hidden inside of me now, i'm whole and very happy.  you're doing the right thing; with good professional help, she'll be a lot better off than before she did them! she may turn her \"hurt inner child\" into a \"blissful one,\" and be as she was before the abuse occurred!     boomers are powerful and should be used with a shaman if you can, if not someone who is a professional in mental health.  i do it all on my own, solo journeys; however, i also have done years of meditation and have a lot of control over my emotions and mind, so i would not say to others to do as i do unless they have the required control!@ it depends on the kind of healing you are seeking. lsd tends to be more focused on the mind whereas shrooms are more focused on the spirit, and mdma more so on the emotions.@ that's cool, i'm just an old man, who started doing lsd close to when it first was being done and i used it before i smoked weed. so i should say at my age, i don't do it for fun, i worship it as one of my most powerful teachers and healer. ;)@ i find with lsd it is a little more tricky, the other comments here are correct.@ safe is up to how pure the mdma is. i have done it and told others, and they have benefited from it, as well. the combo is fantastic for getting over childhood or other trauma. use it for healing \"only\" is what i'd advise, don't waste the experience on just having fun.  the shrooms will bring things up that would otherwise be difficult to deal with, and the mdma makes it easy to deal with it. do it respectfully and carefully, remember this is sacred medicine!@ it works, i been testing that idea for years, as well as shrooms with mdma.@ i'd like to ask one more time, is there a petition drive? i'll start one but i do not like to duplicate effort! please post it here if there is one, i'll sign and spread the word! if not i'll start one and post it here!@ is there a petition drive?@ i will spread the word, as well, brother! the fire in me is raging!@ what i meant by the \" same rulers \" was that they are the same bloodline, basically the same families. there is no \"deep state,\" the \"evil ones\" are in plain sight, not hiding, just diverting,  deceiving, and casting illusions. this slave/master relationship is a fact, not fantasy, and is provable.  don't mistake the wealthy for them; they are not; they are slaves as well. the rich are the overseers, the slaves that help the \"masters\" keep us under control!  the \"masters\" love rebellion, but they hate if we come into our real power and start to love each other. \"love\" is the most potent weapon to bring them down because love will help us evolve beyond them, and they will have no power over us if we unite beyond the divisive means that they use to control us; religion, politics, and business!!!@ voting is merely appeasement to give us slaves the illusion of having a say.  the same rulers have been in control since the days of the god-kings. that time of the masters called the \"god-kings\" is the root of government.        we were not always \"governed;\" there was a time when everyone took care of each other, and no one over us existed or needed to make us or tell us what to do!@ i had set up a new social network to help us get back to how we were before we lost our way. for the few who want to make the journey back there, this is the network:               but you can't get in there without being invited. if you want an invitation, send an email to;  earthwarrior1313@gmail.com@ what actions to stop this madness is being taken?   what can people do? and is there a call for warriors?@ my apologias, be well, and much happiness to you!@ i live a few different lifestyles, the one i love, is in the wilds.  when i'm there, i  don't need anything but what i find there. because of my other lifestyles, they interfere with me living that way all the time, so i usually don't have the time to get extra wild foods for winter; thus, i need to take in supplies. i often take in dry goods now in reusable tins, i use to use glass, but they break too easy. my point is, in my life in the wilds, i have no waste.@ every stone holds the bones of the ancestors; in the wind, if you listen, you can hear their voices,  the old ones are still here to teach the young ones that they will never disappear!  as long as our mother earth exist so will the native people, the colonist and imperialist, the invaders lack the spiritual connection to our earth mother and the \"great spirit\" to be sustainable. when they meet their inescapable demise, the native people will once again rise!!!@ native traditionalists always had plenty of wild game. the reason was they never over hunted and saved hunting for when they had no other options or when their four-legged relatives were overpopulating. you're right, the way people are now, with the amount of greed and looking out for only themselves, there will be little to none to go around!@ yes, it depends on the beans and how you cook them. i have had azuki beans stored for up to 10 years, and black beans up to 5 had no problem with them; however, garbanzo beans were hard after just a year. sprouting the beans before cooking them tends to make them easier to prepare. you can also plant them no matter how hard they get. planting them is where the real advantage is, even if they all don't grow, a lot will.  talking about hard to cook, did you ever try cooking wild carrot (queen anne's lace)? i tried for three days; however, after a couple of years of experimenting, i found that grinding them or chopping them into tiny pieces works. it only took a couple of hours, if that long.@ a worldwide famine is highly possible, both india and africa have significant problems added to the shortages contributed to the pandemic.  beans don't only have a long shelf life; you can plant them and get more. any whole grain would also have that advantage.  every time you go to the store, buy a little extra, keep this practice until you have a ten year supply.  don't hoard, as to help minimize shortages.  the following is a shortlist of some of the best:    * dried beans, 30 years * rolled oats, 30 years * pasta products, 30 years * potato flakes, 30 years * dehydrated fruit slices, 30 years * white rice, 20 years * powdered milk, 20 years * dehydrated carrots, 20 years     (note; beans nuts and grains are must nutrition when sprouted)    as far as planting food? don't!  it is an easy target. if you can make friends with your neighbors, start a community farm if you can't, or even if you could, it's good to learn about wildcrafting and living forest. most people are unaware of how many foods and medicines naturally grow in the wild.  mushrooms, nuts, all kinds of greens and roots, are easy to hide in plain view!@ if this is your first time, be careful. i did a lot of experimenting with it, all of the sacred medicines are different from one another, and this one is tricky because it has a twin-spirit, both masculine and feminine energy or entity. lsa is water-soluble; it is also sensitive to light. thus the best way i found so far is; to prepare it in darkness or with no direct light. crush the seeds (for the first time 4 - 6 seeds) to a powder, put them in a glass of water the amount of water is not essential, as much or as little as you want. stir the water every 15 or 20 mins for two hours, at about 1 hr and 15 mins add a cut-up clove of garlic then about 1hr 30 mins add some lemon juice. strain out the garlic and seeds through some cheesecloth, disregard it and drink the water. all the lsa is in the water; the garlic takes away most if not all the adverse effects and the citric acid brings the trip on faster.  my usual amount was 13 seeds; however, after i took 22 once, i can now feel the same on as little as three seeds. twenty-two were way too much, and my mind was more open than anything else i ever took, open to an uncomfortable extent. so go slow, it is a life-changer, and it will teach you a lot, but be careful because you may learn more than you are ready for!@ lol  :d@ yeah, i was one of those who falsely believed i was not \"abused,\" not understanding the nature of \"abuse.\" it is not always intentional or sexual or physical; sometimes, it seems so routine that we're not aware we been \"abused.\" in our modern world, there is a culture of abuse, and it goes against what is natural, and we come to accept \"abuse\" as the usual and thereby see it as natural. it is rooted in pure disrespect and dis-empowerment, which results in growing up as not a whole person, weaker and less able to be as strong as we could be!@ i don't know if there is a limit, in regard to safety. i did 22 hwr seeds once, and after that, my tolerance changed. now it only takes 5 to feel like 13, and 3 hwr seeds to feel like 8.  also, i no longer have my only two addictions, weed and sweets. so if you like your \"addictions\" you may want to do less! lol@ perfect!@ sex can be \"divided\" into two distinct categories; fucking and making love.  fucking is pretty much like masturbating with someone else there, whereas, making love, two are becoming one. in fucking people do it for themselves, so don't expect the other to please your desires, in making love the pleasure of one is the pleasure of both. if there is a pretense of making love, and your lover is not going to do a 69 with you, then you have been fucked!@ i see your point and the knowledge that is commonly understood your right, however the term here is \"original tribalism.\" at one point we were more evolved than we are now. we had a unity among us, and an understanding of our collective oneness that no longer exist. what i'm proposing is an evolutionary process to get back there.  what is lacking with movements is a holistic approach to meaningful change. we are currently going through the end of a long cycle of 5,123 years.  working with these long cycles will produce a more loving world, if the people can become awaken enough.@ i wish what i know now; i knew when i was younger. i'd have a lot more teeth, lol.  i'll tell you some tricks you can look into and use: clove oil, cayenne pepper, will work for pain, a \"lasting filling\" is \"made\" from using clove oil with zinc oxide, oil pull with coconut oil is excellent for general oral health, ginger mixed with white flour will draw out an abscess, goldenseal will take care of the infection and blood poisoning, tea tree oil is terrific for your gums.  these are medicines and, as such, should be used correctly and with caution.  i'm now looking into ways to grow my teeth back, believe it or not, and it can be \"done!\"@ i feel it is essential to inform people about \"medical plants.\" i can survive in the wilds just from what i find there, and more times than a few medical plants have saved me, along with \"meditation.\" you cannot rely on the drugs-industry to provide when everything breakdown!  learn about them grow them and wildcraft them; they been used for thousands of years and work better than what is being \"sold!\"@ when there's a robust, loving connection, you both know what each other is feeling when it's not right for one, it's not right for the other, no words needed!@ most cops are not warriors, they are not \"trained\" to be warriors, and because of this, most of them go into the field, looking out after their own lives first. they see a gun, and out of fear, they shoot. they don't know how to read people, and they don't know how to disarm people, they don't know how to deescalate a potentially dangerous situation. they don't merely need to be \"defunded,\" they need to be \"replaced\" with \"warriors,\" people who are \"trained\" to serve, protect, and, most importantly, \"sacrifice\" when necessary. they need to learn what bravery is. it is not merely dealing with fear; it lacks it all together!@ i have lived home-free for about 30 years, and i love it. yes, it is a very, very different lifestyle, and very few can do it. all the same, for those few that can, there are a lot of tricks to make it very blissful. for starters, you're free! free from bills and the pressures to pay them. from needing to work all the time so you can get what you need to continue working and maybe be let out of your self-made prison for a week or two a year, you know that's called a vacation. if anyone is interested, let me know? and i'll tell you how it's legally done!@ keep it clean, just don't be mean! lol  :d@ a white lie, no, big lie getting bigger, yes, you know what to do. now what you may ask yourself, is it \"him\" that you want, or is it the idea of him? once the lying started, the relationship on some level is over, and what you have left is only an illusion that looks like someone you want.@ the problem with all modern relationships is the same problem we are having with our relationship with our planet, they are unnatural. this problem is probably something that most people do not understand or want to follow. no one person will ever be perfect for any other person. you'll relate in some areas but not in others, and that is ok. however, when this unrelating comes to sexuality, it is a significant problem that is at the core of why people couple in the first place. the drive, the natural drive for coupling, is to have children, not merely friendship. you don't need to marry a friend; the whole idea of marriage is doomed to failure because natural desires are forever changing, and the inherent need to help many species, including ours, evolve is rooted in diversity.@ anarchy is a liberating system of governance as a response to the notice of being governed. \"anarchy\" does not apply to the original tribes of the americas.  there were councils, usually of elders, that advised but did not command, or make laws and rules. the people took care of each other, and there was no need for anyone to tell them to do that!    call the people by the name of their tribe, call a  dakota a dakota, call an apache an apache. you would not call an italian a rusian; they are different tribes!    but be careful some names were \"given\" them, that was not what they gave themselves and, as such, was derogatory.  *din* is what most people know of as navajo. navajo now has a deferent meaning than when the spanish first gave it to them; initially, it meant cutthroat!@ please do not concern yourself with enlightenment; it is a gift to the worthy, not something you seek, it is \"given,\" often when someone came to a place where you have nothing and lost everything, as it was with buddha.     if you find it, and you are not ready for it, it will make you crazy. after all, it will not change your life, and you will still feel as you do, and do as you do.    focus on purpose; everyone has a unique contribution to make to our collective reality. this purpose comes from your struggles in life. it is what you need to learn so that you can teach.    your ego is the demon who holds you back because you see yourself as being more than you are and also less than you are. it gives you the confusion of illusions, partially self-inflicted,  more so as an affliction that is \"created\" from living in a world out of balance.    find the point of balance, allow your addictions to leave, and face your hurt inner child. love it, embrace it, and allow it to grow into your blissful child, and from there, you'll find your real purpose!@ birch, yes, i'm into being wild and free and the \"birch,\" gives so much to me! i use the outer bark to build shelters both above and below ground, the inner bark is rich in iron. oh don't worry i don't cut them down, in a grove, there is always plenty lying around! one year i ate some red bark high up in the mountain, it was fermented, drunk i became, so i stumbled all the way down.@ in a sense, you can think of it as the absence of \"ego.\"  yet, to be more truthful, it is the realization of \"true-oneness.\" an oneness with and as all that exists and does not exist. this statement may seem like merely a play on words, it is not, it is trying to convey a truth that goes beyond words, yet can be experienced, in a state of blissful-peacefulness.@ when you come to the place where you sincerely know you do not exist, you'll be at peace.@ the native people of this nation are beautiful, resilient, after everything they have been through, 500 years of genocide, and they are still here. they will always be here, even after all of the trumpites are gone after all the exploitive corporations are gone after all the pollution is gone, they will still be here!    i have lived among them, i have fought for them, i have put my life on the line for them. i am an honorary member of two tribes, but that does not make me them. i do not have their power, nor do i have their beauty!    they will be here, and they are here, they will always be here, turtle-island is there's, they are here forever, all others are temporary!@ we are in a world that is driven by abuse. from the cradle to the grave, you are being \"abused,\" or you are the abuser. this abuse is the norm, so why would it be a surprise that there is no respect for the traditions of others?    now having said that, i will also say we are at a time, a crossroad as the hopi would say, a time of a beautiful and great transformation! a spiritual evolution, an awakening is occurring, and this world driven by abuse is killing itself as a new world of love is being born! blm and so does rlm,  and they will matter until we no longer see any real difference in the many shades of our skin.@ wow, i'm impressed! i've never done morning glory seeds. ok, a few wild ones, but very few. did not really have any affect. i did 8 hwr seeds the first time i did it. just ate them, was sick and super sleepy. after that i did some research. tried a few different ways and found that grinding them into a powder putting them in water, just a small amount. letting them sit there in the dark for two hrs. stirring them every 15-20 mins or so. after about an hour and 15 mins adding chopped garlic, just one clove. then finally adding lemon juice, just a little about 1 hour and 1/2 was great! i started with only 8 seeds than my regular amount was 13 seeds for a while (a couple times a month for about a year). i did also mix hwr with shrooms and even lsd with super learning journeys, actually vision quest.   then get this one, i read that someone did 20 seeds, so i tried 22, not the best idea. my mind was way too open, i mean unlike anything i ever experienced, opened to an unpleasant extent. on that trip \"spirit\" kept on saying; \"smoke the herb\"  i was like, no way, i'm already too far out. all the same, in my warrior tradition i must always do as spirit commands. i was saying; can i just go to sleep. way to awake and again mind super-open! spirit, says no! smoke the herb! so i smoked it, and it was by far the worst cotton-mouth i ever had. i mean like nothing was getting rid of it. i asked again, \"spirit\" can i please go to sleep? finally \"spirit\" let me. now this was the strangest part: the next day my only two addictions were gone, i had no craving for herb or sweats! now it only takes 3 seeds to feel like i did on 13, and even 5 is too much, strange hey?@ you have must bad seeds, and the way you're taking it is not the best. lsa is water-soluble; that's only part of it you want. the rest is what makes you sick. i got the best seeds from  .  i took 22 in a little bit of water. i powdered it, only kept it in the glass of water for 2hrs, about an hour and 15 mins i added garlic, and at an hour and a half, i added lemon juice.  the trip was a bit much, with the mind expansion, well beyond what i expected to an uncomfortable extent. the strangest part was that my craving for my only two addictions (sweats and herb)  was gone, the following day, and stayed that way ever since.     oh, it is very important to keep it in the dark until you take it!!!@ sure looks like it! but it sounds like you have not done it yet if you're questioning. so be careful, the seeds are more powerful then you may think. there are a few good ways to use them, but just eating them, is not one of them!\n",
      "im trying very hard to take care of that! thank you!@ thank you@ my moms adopted brothers wife@ this is great advice - thank you!@ thanks for taking the time to write. i think you hit the nail on the head with your first paragraph. that is my dad in a nutshell!   yes, my siblings and i have tried having this conversation with him but we didnt word it as concisely as you did and perhaps some of the real meaning got lost in all the fluff and politeness. i think it would do us all good to sit him down and say that.@ my mom is a very complicated person. she has to be on meds otherwise she would not be able to function, and be institutionalized for either hurting herself or others. so yes, shes been on meds her whole life. her meds keep her as stable as she can be, which is how she is now. she is impossible to talk to about anything, especially things that she does that are hard for others. ive tried countless times and its always led to me being punished or her crying and telling me im a terrible daughter. its just not worth the fight anymore and ive come to terms with it. i agree its an incredibly horrible and rough disease and i dont understand whats going on in her head, and ive seen therapists specifically to work on my relationship with her to get to where we are now because i want her to be in my childrens lives and she loves them very much.  i am trying to be as supportive as i can without getting too hurt, and without having it affect my family. thanks for your time and support!@ ah, he might and there wouldnt be much we could do about it. its his money and hes free to do what he wants with it, but it would be sad for her to receive everything after making all our lives (and ultimately, i think, his life) a living hell. i am trying hard not to lose my relationship with him. thanks!@ its hard to keep out of it because i love them but i understand what youre saying. theres not much i can do to help and it could easily hurt me, too.@ thank you so much for sharing your story. yes, i feel very much the same as you do about my parents being children. sometimes im shocked by how immature and naive they are being and its hard to understand how they raised me to be honest.   i think its really important to at least voice your opinion instead of keeping it inside. like you said, by doing that at least my parents are aware of how i feel and may think about it from time to time. i really hope youre right and that life will throw us a curveball and things will be ok. thanks again for your empathy and advice.@ yes! i agree! yea we had a sibling intervention a few months ago and told him how we felt, a lot of the things you mentioned here, and thankfully he is going to therapy over my brothers death. i really hope it helps him. a lot of people have mentioned family therapy and i think its a really good idea. im going to look into it and talk to my brothers and sister.   and what you say about him getting some clarity through therapy is my deepest hope. i hope he can somehow see that my aunt isnt a healthy choice for him and that he needs to be single for awhile and find someone outside the family to be with. i havent mentioned the pregnancy thing to him but maybe i should~hmmm~  thanks for your positivity - too!@ i totally agree. you hit the nail on the head. yeah, my mom is filing for divorce now but says she doesnt actually want to divorce my dad, just give him a year to figure out what he wants and not string her along anymore~.i think it was the right decision for her and im very proud of her for doing it. she definitely buries her feelings and i think thats one of the issues they have as a couple. she never really cried about my brother passing and i feel like my dad felt abandoned. but i know deep down she mourns him very much. thanks for your comment.@ ahhh im not sure im brave enough to do that! i worry hell be embarrassed, angry, etc.. the only reason im posting on here is bc he has no idea what reddit is and will never find this post. i will think about it. maybe i could even sit him down and consolidate this thread for him someway. i know if i sit down and say look dad, this is a post i made on a website called reddit where nice strangers read my problems and give me advice~.this is what i wrote about you! hes going to kinda freak out~.but i dunno!@ its really hard to talk to my cousins because they are so young and im not sure they know whats happening (14, 16, and 18). the 18 year old is also having a ton of problems - drug abuse, drinking, being arrested, he just got an ex-gf pregnant and isnt taking responsibility for the baby etc.etc. i would hate to be the one that tells them their mom is having an affair with my dad. i just dont know what to do about that. im so worried this will cause a huge rift in our family and i wont be close to them anymore. they really need loving, supportive people in their lives.@ thank you. yes, i have a beautiful family of my own and they are keeping me sane and happy through all this mess.@ thank you for this. i am definitely trying to take care of myself and i have a beautiful family of my own that im trying to shield from all of this. i know my dad isnt the innocent victim but i cant help but feel that hes also super vulnerable now as hes so depressed, lost, and suicidal, and it makes it easier for someone like my aunt to step in. i do agree with you though that hes an adult and he knows what hes doing, though, even if he doesnt realize how terrible my aunt is.  i think i have to come to peace with this in my own way and try to be there for them but also live my own life.@ yeah, another thing i forgot to mention was that when my aunt was splitting from my uncle, my dad bought a house for my uncle to get him gone. at the time we thought he was doing them both a favor because they didnt have a lot of money, and my dad has helped other people in the family like this countless times so it didnt seem like anything out of the ordinary. this, however, seems more calculated.   i would love to do group therapy. im going to talk to my family about this and see what people think. thank you.@ my mom has some texts from her but thats all we have, other than things shes said outloud to people. i know she has two phones - one that she texts nasty things to my mom on, and another that she texts nice things to my mom. i think she shows my dad the nice text conversations to convince him that my mom is in the wrong and crazy.  i \\*think\\* my mom still has them on her phone and i can ask her to screen shot them. shes not very tech savy.  and my dad seems to have no understanding of the pain my aunt has caused my mom. either that, or he is in denial and doesnt want to admit it to himself. i agree with you that he does has a soft spot for my mom because (regardless of all their problems) he did stay with her for 40 years, and they used to be very affectionate when we were growing up.   my dad just started therapy but i think its focused more around his relationship with my brother (im ok with that! just wish there was someway we could address the shitstorm thats happening now~.). i never thought about family therapy! i would love to do that with my family but im not sure how willing they would be. there are four siblings and two parents, so six of us. would that be too many people? also, i know my mom has been trying to get my dad to go to therapy with her for over a year and hes adamantly refused, so i fear he wouldnt want to go if she was there~.but its definitely something to think about and thanks for that!@ thanks for your comment. i agree everyone in my family needs therapy! ive tried to get my mom to go but she refuses, and ive mentioned it from time to time but my siblings dont seem to feel comfortable with the idea, or at least they dont think they need it. my dad finally started to see a therapist a few months ago and he said its been going ok, but hes not talking to his therapist about this stuff, more-so focusing on my brothers death (which i totally understand).@ also, i'm so sorry to hear of your own loss. it's just devastating@ thank you@ thanks for your comment! he was definitely taken aback when we spoke to him about our worry that she will manipulate him. he said he thought we'd be upset about their age difference or something else ~but yes, he asked if my mom told us this and started to explain that she and my aunt were having \"problems\" and i interjected and explained that it has nothing to do with my mom. i even gave him some examples from my own life. he seemed surprised, like i said, and was defending her for the most part, saying it was her \"italian temperament\" more than anything. i didn't feel like we got through to him but i was glad i said it. at least he might hear my voice in his head next time she says something manipulative or he feels weird about an interaction they have~. thanks for reading my long post and taking the time to respond.@ thank you for your kind words. it means a lot to me. \n",
      "thats pretty messed up. ive had something. similar happen and my friend also gave an excuse. i let it slide and accepted her apology only for it to happen again or for her to make a choice to leave me for something else. youve talked about it and that situation is that. just really be careful and think about the places you go with her keeping in mind that it can happen again.@ i used to do this a lot too!!! and also one of my friends after spending a considerable amount of time self reflecting i ended up calling this little voice the monster. i came to the realization that this monster likes to bully me and tell myself all these crazy little things because as a child someone used to tell me these things so it was engraved in my head. kids brains absorb everything as they are developing and sometimes our inner voice or inner self develops into that person we knew as a child thats why its so important to have healthy parents or caregivers. i came across a book called the power of now where one aspect that is covered is the shadow self. this is the part of you that does this. maybe look it up. its really interesting and youll be able to correct it !@ i was that friend too, it hurts !! and leaves you confused. i get it. if you dont have the energy or mental capacity to then just dont. give it a break. take care of you first. i would always run to help this one friend and she wouldnt do the same for me to then ghost me for a really long time. i say dont help anymore unless you are in a good state of mind and you truly believe that the help and care and friendship is reciprocated.@ i dont think having an alternative look means you have mental problems. it has to do with creativity in expressing yourself. society always has looked at tats and funky hair colors as unstable but thats not the case at all. i think your bf and specially his parents who raised him are stuck with that past mentality. dont ever think there is anything wrong with you bc you chose to express yourself through your body. seeing a therapist isnt a bad thing though, specially after the breakup. many many people love that look and accept it as it your body and you can do as you please.@ thats the most confusing part he got it for me ! lol i think that ill just try to really get it out of him him. at first he wasnt upset but overtime i ended up enjoying the switch more and more@ i do agree. i always wondered if he had an issue with it he says he doesnt. and maybe subconsciously takes it out on me playing.@ hmmm i actually like what you said. i do want to get a job but maybe im distracting myself from doing that. i have asked him if he had a problem with me not working and he said no that the circumstances of the world made me lose the job not me. but maybe he is bothered by it. i know i am most of the time.@ i dont think its bizarre either.. i just want to understand if there is a more rooted reason? because he wont tell me and brushes it off but then keeps making the comments.@ im currently getting unemployment and have a hefty savings so i do contribute. i buy all of our and our dogs essentials, groceries and split some bills with him. he pays the mortgage and the remainder of the bills. if we go out and he got the check last time, i get it and vice versa. i maintain the house clean and wash all our shit. tbh i do hate not having a job and just being a house wife lol.@ sometimes i do deny his invites but its bc hes going out with his friends to do his action sports that i def cant do or have interest in watching. he did mention sometimes he has to repeat himself bc i dont listen bc im too into the game. but im usually a great listener.. i dont know if hes just too invested in those tiny moments to ignore that im not addicted and i do listen and we do other stuff.@ im totally not. im super ocd about cleaning and usually have the house spotless. laundry done and will most of the time make us food.@ hes still working and im not. i dont play all day long but when he does come home im usually playing. so he probably thinks i played all day. well talk and eat and hell put on his show and ill play. but yes i do play a lot infront of him bc we live together.@ its perfectly okay to speculate what he might be thinking or why he did some things. but overthinking it to a level where youre hurting yourself is no good. the unfair part is that he isnt giving you an explanation or apologies or just sharing why!  i lost my friend of 10 years so i completely understand that this situation really hurts. but at the end of the day i had to accept how maybe we just have grown apart. she sucks at communicating and validating others feelings also so it was kinda a closed end type of situation. she hurt me in many ways and when id confront her shed just dismiss it and move on leaving he hanging. i decided to just take space from her and give it time. i dont know if well ever have the same friendship again but in the 2 years we havent really been friends i found others and was able to focus on me.@ you should also try to stop contacting him wether its voicemail, text, email whatever. you have tried to bring some peace into this issue and make it right but hes not meeting you half way. let time cool things off and try to just focus on you for now. you shouldnt allow yourself to be a doormat. since you never stood up for yourself before he probably doesnt know how to react to that. which in itself is fucked up.@ hmm well before this all went down it sounded like you were kinda the second back up option for him. im sure you did have your good times but that sometimes isnt enough to overlook the bad.   you said he gaslighted people? how so?? maybe thats why the friendship lasted so long bc he knows how to manipulate his friends and situations in his favor?   what is it that you truly miss about the friendship?? do you miss him or the memories?  you did realize you shouldnt have had that outburst and tried to meet up to apologize but he couldnt see that and also cant rationalize his own behavior for bringing you there. any relationship wether romantic or friendship takes 2 people. sometimes people dont wanna accept their wrong doings and in their mind will rationalize it was the other persons fault.@ yeah shes not over her crazy boy phase its annoying but def putting those boundaries and space back@ i mean if you are close you can spark up that conversation. she might be offended by it who knows. i have long history with this girl so thats why i felt it was ok to say that to her. but yeah it sucks so much. its like youre third wheeling with your friend and some stranger guy, only for her to move on in like 5 sec to another guy.., instead of actually chilling. its funny too bc i did stop giving her a lot of my time, and just hanging with my bf/ other friends, she tried calling me out for being in boy land lol i think she was just mad i didnt give her my time anymore but idgaf. i recently reintroduced her to my bfs/ my other friends and she ends up hooking up with my bfs friend who has a gf.. it caused alot of drama and now shes not allowed over when theyre here so@ omg i feel you. i have a friend who is exactly what you described i become so burnt out after hanging out with her bc thats all she does. whenever wed go out shes try to talk or flirt with literally half the guys at the bar. she doesnt just sit and enjoy the time its like shes on a mission. i stopped hanging out with her a lot bc of the burnt out feeling, were still good friends though and always will be. ive brought this up to her and she acknowledged that shes guy crazy she just wants to feel wanted and have attention. which in itself is also annoying to be around. she hasnt changed even though she is seeing someone and idk if she will change unless she digs deep about the issues making her seek out that attention.@ hes okay with thinks people should just move on and be accepting. i do agree with you though, it is all maturity i just hope they dont come with weird energy.@ i am a little uncomfy by it, but i dont know if im just overthinking or being weird.@ no dont let them come?@ society has given women this ideology that theyre needy, bossy or too much. maybe she doesnt wanna come off as overly needy or overbearing even as a friend. it sucks bc when a woman is assertive and talks her mind shes a labeled a bitch. im not saying she thinks you think this of her, its kinda something that overtime women sadly fall into~ its super subconscious.@ first off i dont think you should be embarrassed and if someone offers to help its bc they care. but if you really dont want the help then maybe start by bringing in a large garbage bag into the room and throwing away all the actual trash and/or super dirty items you have. after you clear up some space take your time and make organization piles see if its stuff you wanna keep. i have depression and i know that when i come home to a messy room or house i feel 10xs worse. i used to be super messy but got into the habit of frequently organizing and throwing shit out. it def makes way for you to be able to think clearer and feel better. its one less thing that makes you think ughhhhhh@ well if you cant even see yourself marrying him and spending your life with him then id say this relationship is over. he also didnt actively listen to your requests and opinions about weddings and proposals. sounds manipulative on his part, having an audience to pressure you into saying yes. also its not fair to him. he wants to get married and have a wedding and all that and you simply dont like those things. sounds like yall are incompatible in the dynamics of what makes a relationship good for you as individuals.@ we are having some food and drinks which i want lol but after that i just wanna go be. is it bad that he kinda just lets me know last minute too or is that normal ish? he doesnt ask me if im ok with it or if im up for it or if i wanted to do something else ( which today i did)@ if it really means a lot to you you should express how this all made you feel. definitely call her out in a way that doesnt attack her and share how confused you were left. ask her what happened.. maybe the guy made her block you. but have an open convo about it. definitely dont let her manipulate your feelings about it this though. if after the discussion you still feel confused and left behind after you provided support than simply just tell her you would t like to talk anymore.@ its gotten pretty bad and weve tried to talk to him without insulting her.. and he seems to agree and feel empowered then he goes and sees her and hes back to square one@ as a background theyve been dating since they were in highschool. this is his first and only girlfriend.. his first lay his first everything. i feel like hes holding on to that hope that they were good then so they have to be together forever.@ he used to. he stopped bc my bf and i used to give him the honest truth and advice on how its wrong. he used to listen and seem to grasp what is happening but kinda just turn around and do the opposite.@ he used to talk about it all the time, complain all the time and my bf and i used to give him advice. he would get pumped and then go and forget everything we said and just do whatever it is she wanted. hes super nice but jokingly calls her satan. and makes comments here and there that suggest theyre not even compatible!@ its really tough to deal with depression. and its tough to lose someone youre close to. at the end of the day we gotta pick ourselves back up and try super hard to come out on the good side of things. i think that bc of his current relationship you no longer should try to contact him. i know its hard but you can and will find others that care and provide support for you.   you should also try to find hobbies or new interests to keep you occupied and not thinking about the loss. itll help you find yourself better and learn about you! who in reality is the most important. dont ever forget you got your own back. make a daily to do list and try to accomplish it. make another list of things you would like to try and places youd like to go. make another list of things you love about yourself and ways youve made yourself proud. losing people you care about sucks ! but the show must go on. pick yourself back up and know everything will be okay if you invest your time and thoughts on bettering yourself.  but no you shouldnt message him or try to contact him, hes made his decision and unfortunately can no longer be your friend.@ it sucks bc we have been friends for 10years. i feel you on a whole level. i hope so too, i also figure that i like helping people but that can backfire bc people will see that and begin to use it.@ i have a friendship exactly like this.. i figured out this person is an opportunist. only truly reaching out when she needs me and choosing other people and situations over me for her benefit. its truly frustrating and it hurts! i say you can be there for her since she is going through something tough but be aware and careful that she will probably ignore you after.@ sounds like he has adhd.. not being able to focus on what is literally happening bc his thoughts are way too far ahead. id say talk to him about it intimacy shouldnt be like this.  also its okay to joke around but during sexual activities it sounds a bit immature. dont feel obligated to continue or try to get him hard again, when he does this it seems like his head is elsewhere anyways.@ this is totally random but. my boyfriend suggested i try to reconnect and hit her up for a get together were having. i did. i messaged her to invite her and she didnt respond, maybe thought she didnt see it. this morning i looks to see who saw my stories from last night and there she was front and center. lol so i was like ah did she respond i went to look and she left me on read -.-@ oh wow thats actually terrible. no sense of understanding from them at all~ im sorry that happened as something similar did happen to me. but for me it was bc i wasnt smoking anymore so they decided to start excluding me from things even went to a museum without me that i had suggested weeks before lol people are funny like that.@ the unwritten girl code ..  i stuck with my decision and were happy, just makes me cringe a little to try to hit up someone that insulted me left and right@ i have no idea. i would definitely hope not, he doesnt seem like he would do that but still made me wonder his reasons for saying that.   ive also struggled with this a lot bc of the insults and was told by another friend i crossed her boundaries.. but i do agree she didnt need to take it elsewhere she couldve just said it upset her.@ you need to move away from them. start fresh with tour kids and wife.@ on the same boat, when those thoughts of i wish i had them back surface my head i try to remember why were not friends anymore. all the messed up things they did to me, severe or not. i try to remind myself how we just werent real friends and they were just supposed to be in my life for a little while. definitely try to distract yourself when you feel bad about it like other said pick up on hobbies.  i was friends with someone for 10 years and as we matured i realized she was an opportunist. it hurt to see her chose other people and other situations over me. only reaching out when she needed me. she eventually just faded off and sometimes i get super upset about it bc i was a good friend to her but i realize she wasnt a good friend to me. so that alone eases my mind when i think about it. she didnt deserve my kindness and accessibility.@ wellllll derek is clearly jealous and acting like a child. youve tried to talk to your friend and she just isnt having it probably bc deep down it upsets her that her husband might be jealous. since she is your maid of honor you cant just stop talking and hanging out but i say keep the sharing to a minimal and maybe hang out less as a group and maybe just hang out with her alone@ to be honest they sound kinda mean.. it happens to best of us sometimes and its not something you can control. your body just wasnt having it. the fact that they tried to take you outside is kinda strange too. people usually throw up in bathrooms~. i say give it time but understand that it was an uncontrollable reaction, you didnt do it on purpose. you still can apologize but theyre reaction was off as well.  as other people mentioned, when a friend gets sick i dont get mad at them, regardless of the situation. i try to make sure theyre alright, get them some water and lay them down putting a trash can or bag near the bed. they dont sound like good peoples in my opinion.  what you can say is that you truly are sorry and didnt mean to cause any issues. that you passed your limits and your body wasnt happy. maybe next time take it easy you can partake in whats being done but slow it down, feel it out first before you get green fever.@ good for you!!! proud of your answer. because he went and explored the other options and they didnt work out, he wanted to have you as a back up plan. bitch noooo.@ if youre speaking about personal problems maybe try to hold off and write down some feelings instead. so you have room to talk about other things@ tell your boyfriend to say something to him. not to make them break up or cause tension, people can change. but you dont have to change your mind about her just bc theyre dating now. its to avoid further excuses or feeling uncomfortable being around her while hanging out@ my problem exactly. im good at meeting people and such but maintaining the new friendship becomes hard for me to where usually it just dissolves :/@ huskies are very very active, connected dogs. they basically talk. they need a lot of exercise, a lot and to be stimulated. maybe suggest to them before they leave to take him on long tiring walks, get him puzzle toys/food toys so hes entertained while theyre away. if hes young thats probably the main reason why.@ my friend has a really bubbly loud personality~i dont. although im not really shy im not bubbly or loud. were still great friends though. sometimes she does get on my nerves and when i bring her around other people they think shes too much. i feel like you need to find a middle ground ( not telling you to change) keep that bubbly personality but its best to chose when to fully bring it out. depends on the activity, event or type of mood the people youre with are setting. im not saying dont do it, do it! but with its appropriate tone. what people and i find annoying about it is that when were all casually chilling shes all over the walls, when we try to converse with her she cant keep up bc shes going to fast. it makes it seem as if she doesnt wanna be there and would rather be doing something more lively and loud. just learn to tone it down a little when its appropriate.  edit: another thing is that when people dont acknowledge her loudness or energy she gets weird and quiet and makes it known something is wrong. so just be aware of the reciprocation when socializing with people.@ thats probably it. as a way to deal with anxiety sometimes we pick up ppls behavior or habits to conform to that world and not cause issues but that goes totally against who you are.!! i say take some time for you while still being friendly to just figure out what do i like! write some things down too. as you practice and learn about what you like those old behaviors will leave you as you arent practicing them anymore.. like the gossiping@ find different interest. look for hobbies looks up news anything! sometimes we get caught up in drama and stuff bc we dont have a lot going on. you could talk about something you just took up or are learning or reading. focus on you first expand before you worry about what other people think. its really good you acknowledge you dont really think doing what youre doing is good so just focus on those new different aspects. also stay off social media that shit ruins everything.@ also you just graduated high school and are entering college ! thats when a lot of people part ways anyways and meet so many other new friends@ i had a really similar situation going on with my friend group. overtime i came to the realization i was their friend but they werent my friends, i was kinda part of the group. it hurts and sucks but in the end its better to have peace of mind then to be around people who dont really treat you right. i ended up just not talking them anymore at time it sucks and i feel lonely at times but then i remember all the times i felt used and like and outsider.. then it brings me peace know they dont have access to me anymore. youll find people who value and truly care about being your friend. just give it time and value your time very highly.@ remember this also: you are not that studder~ im sorry that happened to you and it developed later on in life. but you arent that, you are your mind, your thoughts, your ideas, your sense of humor.. i get it can be hard not to overthink but practice just letting it flow and continuing what youre saying and knowing that you still said what you wanted to! if its an option to you, you can take speach therapy ! or if you cant for whatever reason look up whatever free info or videos there are on it. you got this just dont let your mind take over.  ps another thing that helped me was this book called the power of now. i havent finished it(got it years ago) bc im truly trying to understand what its trying to tell me. maybe check that out or similar books.@ just try to remember this: you can re-train your mind to not drift off when you feel anxious. anxiety sucks so much sometimes it feels like it takes over.. but if you try to understand what triggers those moments specifically.. not just social settings~ you can catch your mind trying to get you stuck into that robot mode  another thing that helped me was writing alllll my ticks and triggers down and seeing if they were even real or justified. so when theyd start happening id remind myself : im okay brain! stop it@ this used to happen to me ..a lot. i noticed that allowing myself to get lost in my thoughts made it so much worse. i would start over analyzing the current social situation and every movement i made, every word or how i said it. its awful and im sorry youre going through that. what helped me was breathing.. as lame as that sounds.. id catch myself drifting and i would breath take a look around at where i was (not the people) try to ground myself and just say in your head youre ok. talking to people can be awkward even without anxiety.. so dont beat yourself up just try to ground yourself first and not get caught up observing everything. as for your studder who cares!!!! thats a small thing you shouldnt beat yourself up over.. own it! unless someone is a huge asshole they wont bring it up or say anything about it. look up anxiety grounding tricks and try them when you feel yourself drifting  you got this !!!@ this same exact thing thing happened to me. except my brother is still alive. the only reason why it was taken seriously is because my school counselor cracked me down and i told her she got the police involved and so then my mom had to take it seriously. i say keep the journal and with given time show it to your parents or the police. you and the other girls he abused deserve emotional and mental help@ youve only been dating for a month! thats no time at all and he already feels like he wants to do shit with other girls~. it seems like he was used to doing it with whoever and doesnt understand how relationships work. even if you say no hell probably eventually got out and do it. break up with him hes not good boyfriend material. if you dont wanna end it, fine. but do not give in to this cheat pass. thats the lamest thing ive ever heard. he doesnt respect your title as girlfriend.@ im sure shes been thru tough things in her life that messed her up. but it sounds like shes exaggerating and adding made up details to her her story to make it more intense. the only reason why someone would do this is for sympathy. she might not even realize but she wants to be pitied. she also might just be a pathological liar. they even start to believe what they spit out. its completely unfair to you since you dearly care about her but shes emotionally manipulated you to feel for her in a certain way. maybe shes never had a connection with someone without having to lie. having said that its not justified or fair to you at all, you dont even know whats true or not. and having that convo with her can get real messy. id say try to bring some of the examples you wrote here and see how she reacts. made a point that you just want to understand her but sometimes things dont add up or make sense from whats shes previously said.@ my first question is do you know for sure that this affair is done? secondly what reasons has he given you for you to feel confident and assured that you guys can in fact make it work.  this is totally a point to bring up in therapy.. its another fact he hid from you and not something to just accept. i think its pretty gross of him to involve your kids in it and its something i wouldnt take lightly. he manipulated your innocent kids to be part of his secret. i cant tell you what to forgive or not. no one can. but its something that you have to consider. dont look at this as just an affair or the whole picture. consider all the parts separately and how it goes against what you believed to be true in your family.@ i had a friend for 10+ years in high school we were inseparable. after graduating we branched out made new friends and it caused arguments between a us. it became sorta a codependent friendship (more on her part) she would be mad at me and ignore me when i would be around other people. whenever id try to speak with her about it she would try to call me out for normal behavior and when id call her out she just made excuses and denied it. i would be her friend, her therapist, basically her go to person. whenever she had guy problems i was always there to reason and make her feel better. it sucked because she wasnt that for me. she began just using me for support and ignoring and excluding me from her group of friends (which some were mine too). my last straw was when i suggested we all go to this museum in the city and she ignored my messages.. a week later i see shes posting pics of her in the city at that museum with her other friends. when i started dating my new boyfriend she completely brushed me to the side. sometimes hitting me up here and there to see if she still had access to me. she moved away to another state and i went to her going away party it was ok, her new friends were way older &rude. she left and this summer has been back and didnt bother to tell me or ask me to hang out. i guess we never officially ended our friendship but its done. it really hurt how it played out and how used i felt regardless of our long past. i hope someday i get the chance to tell her how her actions affected me and how i dont really want anything to do with her. i know in her mind she thinks she did nothing wrong and will eventually try to seek me out when she needs me.@ do not act like you dont know. this is terrible and im truly sorry this is happening. i wouldnt wish this on anyone. but pretending like things are fine and dandy will not work. i say speak to a lawyer first to see what your options are as far as the baby goes/money for the baby. after youve seeked out advice talk to your disgusting husband. calmly. i would talk to yourbfftoo telling her you know and confirming it. save the proof. and maybe do agree to meet up with paul to see what else he has as evidence of this.@ try to be open to other interest than just those. definitely try to have those types of friends where you can play and share whatever without them taking it bad, but also expand on what other ppl might be interested in. you dont need friends that are 100% like you to feel good about company@ you should encourage him to start eating healthier and at the least invite him to go on walks with you! or hikes. as for his back he should probably see a physical therapist or get some sort of massages. guys lose weight easier than women, if he changes maybe that ;healthy eating and walks itll make a difference. i dont think you should outright say he repulses you that could be more damaging than good, he is probably already going through it/beating himself up even though it might not seem like it. start small and slow with changes and overtime ask him to do actual work outs with you!@ i think that before you cut your loses you should definitely talk to her about it..call her out! thats messed up of her to do if she wanted more people yall couldve just gone all together. regardless of the excuse or explanation i think if you dont fully cut her off still focus your love and attention elsewhere.@ welp she just invited herself to my house so i can fill out applications for her.. since ive been avoiding going to hers or doing it for her@ not diagnosed or that we know of. but im sure she does. she def has undiagnosed behavioral issues@ thats what i have been doing lately. (after talking to her of course)basically ghosting~? her almost. it sucks thats what its come down to. i just hope it brings some type of positivity to her taking initiative.@ you probably arent even struggling to make the point.. im sure youve tried time and time again using different explanations.. the thing is he just doesnt care what they are. you could make a powerpoint explaining why perfectly and hell still say it doesnt make sense.. 5 years is a pretty long time for someone to not validate how youre feeling..just imagine how itll be when the relationship gets longer and he gets more comfortable. his mentality here is immature and he simply wont hear you out, thats why his view on this is the only one that matters.   i had an ex that did the same except he would hear me out and promise change but didnt follow through. he would literally stand me up at bars or events, wouldnt reply or answer my calls for a few days and just show up like nothing happened bc he was just with his friends, no big deal right.. urg i truly cared and had love for him but decided to put myself first. it was amazing. after we had broken up i found out he had been talking to other girls and doing drugs and just hiding it really well. im thankful that i was able to ignore his feelings and my imagine of us and acknowledged my feelings. girl you can do way better, never forget you come first.@ lol they are children you need new friends if you cant verbalize what upsets you or take space without them getting mad .. pshhhh@ its really weird bc the girl had been in what seemed a happy 2 year relationship with someone else. i never wouldve imagined she had the idea that they would ever get back or that she still had feelings for him. either way it sucks she felt that way and i didnt know and went ahead with my decision. as for my other friend maybe she doesnt have a problem with but its hurtful she dropped me and went with her. on other news ! both those girls are actually in mine and my bfs town right now~ we love in a lake and i saw the past few days theyve been posting the lake and a location pin~ its all really weird. i almost wanna hit them up lol@ thank you. i will for now try to just let it be and if im the future i get the chance to tell her i will. i always felt like something was off about our friendship~. i shouldve trusted my gut instead of always falling for her i need you moments, which its basically what it came down to before this happened. i feel like she used me for support but i wasnt her friend if that makes sense. she will send little comments on my stories and i will reply and then she just ghosts me again.. i just know that since shes buddies with the other girl they probably tore me apart and that hurts the most.. i was always good to them no matter what. i guess they didnt see my decision as mine and something that would make me happy they saw it as the first thing that went against what they wanted.   im sorry that happened to you but im glad you stood up for yourself. it sucks how people you consider real friends can end up treating you.@ i had a similar problem with a long time friend. we had our codependent phase and even though i wasnt okay with it she becomes very attached to one person, very draining. eventually she tried calling me out for being codependent. she attached herself to another friend and basically didnt want to talk to me or make plans or hang out. it sucked bc i was always there, as a friend a therapist and helping hand and even though i tried to talk to her about it she acted like she cared but continued her behavior. i always had that off feeling too~ we gotta trust our gut more..  but anyways i tried talking to her i have space to her only moving along as if nothing happened. i shouldve let her go years ago when i knew my off feeling was right!@ hmmm your friends arent respectful of your boundaries and sound extremely inmaduros!! i would say take some space from these so called friends dont give them a reaction because this is what it sounds like theyre going for. you deserve to be respected by friends not made the monkey in the middle.@ she sounds high maintance ~ thats a no from me@ hmmm what kinda apps@ my mom does this exact thing. shes narcissistic. and needs to finish to get a reaction out of you or whoever no matter if they know it already. they do this bc the reaction they were fishing for wasnt met and theyre trying to get it.@ you didnt cross a line she couldve easily said hey busy text you later. i dont think this girl is very nice and has issues of her own. i say keep her blocked or if you dont let her know what she says and how she acts is strange and you have no energy for that.@ my sister is part of something like that, & yes it definitely can get judgy. but ughhhi feel you got any ideas for meeting people i could use some lol  im good at meeting new ppl and becoming friendly but never good at making it an actual friendship :/@ is there any sort if mommy groups you can join maybe you can meet people there??@ i feel you :/ i went thru something similar when i started dating my now bf i lost probably all my friends. there was some weird secret love triangle that i & him didnt know about. basically 2 of them wanted him and i didnt know and then my childhood friend took their side when i decided to proceed with him. but in all that it made me realize that they werent really my friends. its almost better to have nothing than friends who would drop you at nothing~?@ i think youre the problem lol. maybe try to be more observant about the situations that get you into these dramas or issues~ before acting out or saying anything. being observant saves you a lot a lot of problems and makes you realize a lot you mightve missed before@ hmmm ghosting people isnt the best, imagine if someone did that to you. that being said you can stop being friends. specially with friends you feel youve outgrown. i say maybe just play it out how you have and if she ever mentions something tell her how you feel and that the things she says bother you.  what i usually do when things like that used to happen is write it out on my notes. like a letter to that person. then go back edit it and send it to them. it helps collects thoughts better and gets your point across@ was there a reason you disconnected from friends ??@ same~ i have my boyfriend but it sucks not having anyone else there@ its because our minds remember the bad way more than the good. specially if you have depression. we tend to replay the bad in our heads while we just momentarily feel the happy moments and then move on. try to reprogram your brain to replay the happy as much as we daydream about the bad decisions, choices or consequences.@ throughout life we lose a lot of people we never thought we would. specially high school friends. its kinda inevitable specially if they move away. that being said it is messed up she just found new buddies and forgot about you, since you tried to keep contact and all. i lost most my high school friends and my middle school high school friend we were friends for 10 years~ she changed a lot and when id try to see whats up she would be so vague and then just stop responding. i figured out she was an opportunist and would drop someone or something no matter the history for whatever seemed better or more interesting to her. this isnt real friendship. i stay civil and cordial with her but its not the same and it hurt for a while. its ok to hurt over the loss of a friend but if they arent caring about it or even want to keep in touch whats the point of you trying and trying. itll only drain you more. i say try to slowly find new people which i get is super hard. it does get better trust the process and trust the reason why she isnt in your life anymore.@ so the guy ended up telling the girlfriend but he basically said my friend assaulted him. which is not what happened~ i got the story from him then hours later her and they matched. yet he went and told his gf something else, a really serious accusation@ what they mean is that they would like to hang with you for a bit while in your city nothing long or extravagant maybe catch up over some food and then part ways.@ definitely the best case for it, just dont get caught up in what this guy is trying to brew! keep going on with yourself and be happy ! itll probably piss him off lol@ also think about why this bond started was it cause you clicked so much or you were bored and lonely. i dont think that being curious to the other sex is something terrible ! giving something youre programmed to perceive as strange or wrong a chance might turn into something amazing!@ like many other people here i feel like you wanna end it bc of the fear of what people will think and say. do you enjoy this more than just a friend? you can enjoy these things with him but solemnly as a friendship leaving all the mushy stuff to the side. or do you really enjoy the feelings and more you get from him? i think you just think on it and dont ruin the bond bc you are afraid. just bc youve never given thought to maybe being bi doesnt mean its not there.. definitely think of wether you want just the friendship and jam sessions or the more. either way dont do anything drastic and hurt this guys feelings and possibly ruin a great thing there. as a side this guys cousin who is your friend might know by know so maybe you are overthinking it.@ oh and to add ! this friend of yours is only speaking badly of you to draw the attention off his cheating ass so he doesnt seem as bad. he fucked up he did someone wrong .. youve done nothing wrong including liking her.@ i would say this person is not your friend. i was in a similar predicament but im the girl. i ended up dating the friend and we are so happy together!!! (2 years and going strong) you wouldnt imagine the kind of things that were said about me and my now boyfriend. i did lose many people as did he~ but it kinda ruled out who was really there for us and who wasnt. who was being fake and who was only tight with us for their benefit. it hurt and seemed like a long ordeal but overtime everything fell into place we are happy we have new and old friends, the real ones who saw past all that immature drama. my ex spoke hell of me made me out to be the worst person ever ~ even before i got with this friend. i always worried about what was being said and to who but in the end it doesnt fucking matter ! they will speak shit and the right people will see through it.@ you need to absolutely address this or shell stay forever. shes kinda mooching off of you right now without regard for your hard work/ disrespected you by not even asking you!!! she literally said im moving in without asking if you were cool with it. i dont know what kinda friendship you have but thats a big no no. shes maybe too comfortable with the type of relationship and will bulldoze your feelings, decisions, and opinions. maybe start the convo by saying so im a bit confused since you said youd only be staying the weekend but it seems youre fully moved in. im really sorry but i cant have a roommate live in my living room. basically ask her to go but state that she can come over for sleepovers and hanging out but living there with you is a different story.  you said she has done nothing wrong but she has ! she totally made a decision about your place without discussing it with you.@ how do you do a flyover!?!?@ ive had this same feeling before but i dont wanna lose it all! too much time and i cannot lose the diy recipes. what i did i basically got rid of my roads made rivers disappear some bigger make islands in the middle make space basically~ and slowly decide which buildings you want to move !@ i had a therapist many years ago, they helped with other issues but now that im older i should look into it. the thing is im having problems with my insurance and theyre very expensive :(@ i feel the same exact way. except with all my boyfriends friends. i have one friend left we have a somewhat rocky relationship bc we are so different and that makes me feel that i really dont have anyone im tight with. its hard making friends when youre older too i always feel stuck. we are having people over and he invited like 30 people hes friends with and i only invited 2~ it doesnt feel good at all.@ like many people probably said this should be addressed by a professional. they can sit you both down and theyll be there as a middle man to help further understand her trauma by it and make her see you were trying to protect her.@ you throw them out thats what you do! doesnt really sound like these people are your friends.. even if youve had good times and memories they showed they have no respect for you. its better to start fresh with new friends or be a bit lonely for a while but have peace than to have these shitty assholes make you feel bad on purpose.@ well hes your bf and will continue to be let it slide for now and maybe over time theyll have the chance to hang out together@ thats totally okay maybe i was just caught in my feeling of annoyance i didnt see that his point didnt need to include that. when i brought it up i was kinda snippy it was a few days of me brewing it up so i think thats why he was annoyed. totally needed to hear or see that perspective to get that he probably didnt do it maliciously or for weird alternative motives.@ alright well maybe hve a convo with him no drama or yelling just sit down and calmly try to explain and open him to the idea of hanging out more hes your bff hell come around for you@ hmmmm is there a possibility your friend might have feelings for you? has he acted strange with your other boyfriends or said weird comments about your relationships??  youre not overreacting at all thats super mean of him to say and i think 3 times is definitely not enough to know someone.@ okay so i am overthinking?? because that fact didnt matter to the story or point he was making??@ the reason he was telling the story was bc one of his friend never has his back so he was using this one story as an example. but why not tell the story as a whole ~@ thats what i thought too i would never do that i bring him up all the time bc i love him and hes such a great guy~ so this was just super weird to me.. its like silly to be upset about more annoyed he did apologize said he didnt realize it was a big deal but its just more than the story like he didnt place significance in me helping him ya know@ he goes into detail about everything~except how i helped him out in that serious of a situation.@ im gonna keep it vague for privacy issues but  we were out drinking on the boardwalk and my bf got into an random altercation with a younger guy who had a gun.. the younger guy was flashing it to my bf and he was trying to get physical.. our friends stood by and did nothing so i had to step in and got the guy with the gun to leave.  my bf tells the story but completely left out the part where i stepped in and got it resolved. just focuses on how his friend didnt help him and stood by.@ im gonna keep it vague for privacy issues but  we were out drinking on the boardwalk and my bf got into an random altercation with a younger guy who had a gun.. the younger guy was flashing it to my bf and he was trying to get physical.. our friends stood by and did nothing so i had to step in and got the guy with the gun to leave.  my bf tells the story but completely left out the part where i stepped in and got it resolved. just focuses on how his friend didnt help him and stood by.@ it depends. theyre allowed to hang out without you but are they being mean to you? purposely leaving you out? etc~ i had a group of friends do the same at first i was upset but let it slide i didnt have to be there always but then i just started feeling like the outsider even when wed do stuff together.. i was done when i suggested going to this museum and they kinda brushed my message off in the chat and then a week later they post pics of their journey to that same museum~ didnt even invite me. so there are differences in friends actions you just have to see if theyre innocent or if theyre just being dicks.@ im sorry youre going through that :( i myself am too ! making friends is hard man. but hmmmmm id say maybe leave out specific details about yourself like that youre autistic. i say that with no hate or to be rude but that shouldnt defy you and people should get to get to know you for you! not your disability. once you are close with someone it could be disclosed.@ i believe in loyalty and being respectful but that whole girl code guy code is stupid to me. thats how people get territorial, jealous, and try to dictate their thoughts onto their friends. people do not own other people wether its exs, friends just people in general! the thing is i think youre in the right ~ but your friend believes in this idiot code so shell be upset regardless. id say try talking to her and rationalize whats going down. dont let her dictate how youre gonna live out your life.@ totally overthinking it, which is okay.. just try not to get into it with her like seek validation for your presence. after all you were invited if they didnt want you there they wouldnt have.  just go and try to forget that and try and have a good time.@ im sorry i know that feeling as well :( it sucks bc im good at meeting people (most the time) and become friendly but maintaining that new friendship is what gets hard for me then dissolves to nothing\n",

(not that i wouldn't fuck it anyways but it's definitely missing something~.)@ for young women with boobs like yours, yes~~~~~..yes they are.  but for women with gigantic titties then they are necessary accoutrements to prevent them in the future, to have to drag them off the floor and tuck them into their waist bands later in life~~  btw nice butt and great body art (that which we can see of it anyway~.)@ i am pretty sure that this is what women have to go through when they get a mammogram. except it's not for some sort of sexual rush but a real painful procedure to discover if they have a a disease that is going to change their entire lives and make them go through some pretty horrible procedures to just maintain life~~..@ i like the body art~..@ certainly beats david blaine!@ what bugs the hell out of me is that we only allow ourselves two choices when it comes to voting for the top spot in the american government.  there are several candidates out there that are not either democraps or repooplicans, but we completely ignore these guys because they don't have the money to buy resources to run an effective campaign.  so it's not ability that the american public vote for it's money.  so long as money is the main focus of how we pick our leaders then it's money that is going to run this country~..@ well, there you go!@ i usually vote for either buggs bunny or the tazmanian devil myself~..@ body art can be either beautiful and fascinating or just horrible.  it can also be meaningful to the person who is wearing it.  i have found that if someone gets a tatt and tries to \"save money\" it usually turns out to be horrible.  like anything else in life it is always best to get someone who really understands you and your wishes than to get someone who want's to just make a few bucks~~@ yeah, well joe is as corrupt as any other dill hole that is willing to spend millions if not billions for an office that pays only 200k a year.@ yeah, i'm getting pretty fucking tired of picking the least worst asshole for president (and pretty much any elected office lately)~~.@ um-m-m-m we got some ziplock bags in the pantry?@ semper fi?@ right?@ hey!  no fair springing something like this on me, shit, i just fell backward out of my chair!  do you know how difficult it is to jerk off when your legs are higher than your head!?@ nyeah, she hooked up with this worthless asshole and moved to presque isle maine.  seems (according to him anyway) there are less black people and latin people who live up there thus it's a nicer place to raise his kids~~  (maybe the cigarettes caused my daughter to have some brain damage?)@ nope, never had me come and clean your house~~~~~~~  day sucked, kept looking at your picture awaiting your call and never got it.  went to bed crying~~.@ right?@ as a \"never has ever smoked\" and a farm kid as well i have no problem smelling that nasty ass shit.  one of the reasons i did so well as a non-smoking marine was because i could smell it for miles and it was easy to pinpoint opposing forces because they definitely had a lot of people \"with the habit\".  i was able to smell a smoker even in a rain storm.  funny thing is when i was an mp they used to use me as a \"drug dog\" and put me out in front of the px on paydays and i could smell pot on people.  we got alot of busts that way.  i feel kinda bad now because i occasionally do an edible now and then (helps me sleep and is good for the pain in my back) but it's legal now, and it was not back then~..@ right?  i have no idea why but my youngest son and my oldest daughter \"took up the habit\" (without my knowledge!).  my son has quit (thank god for pretty little blonde hair women who think smoking is nasty, because he married one!) but my daughter still does, but we do not see her very often (she lives about an 11 hour drive from us).  but everything that a smoker wears smells horrible and they don't even realize it!@ good to know, i'll keep searching.  i have never even considered smoking.  i think i have my mom and my aspergers to thank for that.  as an aspie i am a bit of a neat freak, and my mom was a filthy (so was my ex if i remember correctly) smoker.  over full ashtrays, butts all over the place outside, in the toilet, smoking while cooking and putting her butts out in her dinner plate during supper~~.  it was horrific!  plus that the smell all the time, blech!  i have no idea why i ended up marrying my ex except maybe because we grew up together (mom says we used to play in the same playpen!) and she was in a bad way and i wanted to \"save\" her maybe?  anyway she never even considered the idea of quitting.  but it wasn't the reason i divorced her though, turns out all the time she was married to me she was seeing her ex on the side (he is a convicted child molester and wife beater and when he was in jail is when i reconnected with her).  so i left (about 40k lighter in the bank account) and went back in the service.  sorry got completely off topic!  any who~.. yeah thank god for my mother because i probably would have ended up with cancer or copd like my little brother!@ check out this web site for ada questions and if you are having problems you might consider a local support group (google it)  https://askjan.org/disabilities/autism-spectrum.cfm@ mine are mostly full of either music or movies.  i have every single album either done by or about harry chapin.

      "and he's already got an angelic face!@ nta. you are right that your husband needs therapy. couples/family therapy might be good, too, but he is the problem here.   >he also doesn't respect our son's limits in terms of social interaction. when we visit my in laws the house is very loud, the other kids play too hard, and our son does not enjoy it. he has asked to bring his switch and play upstairs. my husband said his mom would freak over how rude that was, so i tried to compromise on a book. my husband said no and that it is his job to put him in uncomfortable decisions so he can grow. i think it hurts his feelings that our son doesn't like his grandparents, but i find them very difficult to like, so i can't blame him. my in laws have complained (not in front of him) that our son is too weak and whimpy and we are ruining him.  this was always the exact dynamic at family gatherings on one side of my family: myself, my dozen or so cousins, aunts, uncles, family friends, etc. everyone was a loud talker. everyone just *talked* even if other people were talking, and the only solution to people not being able to hear you was to not talk. i used to beg my parents to let me take a \"break\" at family events to go upstairs. even if i couldn't bring a book, to just sit quietly. my parents always said no, that i was there to visit family and it would be rude.   so now as an adult, i just don't visit on big holidays when everyone is together. on the rare occasions i do, i will politely excuse myself to go take a walk or something -- but it has taken *years* of therapy for me to get to that point. your husband's parenting style -- if it can be called that, and isn't just that he's an asshole -- is setting your child up for a lot of lifelong struggles.@ i've always done this and strongly associated music with places. i live traveling alone and my first solo trip overseas was in 2006. in 2018 i went back with family~ made a playlist of the mix cds i'd listened to on the plane over the first time, and went for an early morning walk to listen and reminisce. it was a really great experience.@ *boop*@ what is this even supposed to accomplish? a faster way to use up matches?@ i teared up at the scene where mando learns his name. little baby grogu was so *happy* to hear his dad say his name! imagine having had such a traumatic, scary life, and then finally you meet someone who loves you and takes care of you, but you can't even communicate your name~until, finally, you can! and props to pedro pascal for the body language in that scene, it was really evocative.   also rosario dawson was *amazing*. she can kick ass all day long -- but she was so tender and gentle with the baby. those little hand squeezes she gave him a few times were just too much.@ there's a clinic at 1894 walton that does sliding-scale dental.@ puppy toofers are the best, up until they decide your hand is a chew toy.@ this is so cool!@ by law train crews and dispatchers can only work x amount of hours, and if they hit that limit, they are not allowed to move the train at all. literally all they can do is wait for a relief crew and then go somewhere for their rest hours.@ epinephrine does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier, so i don't know what if any effect there would be if injected into the brain tissue.   however, any change to the amount of fluid within your skull can have effects ranging from \"killer headache\" to \"basically squishing your brain\", so an injection wouldn't be good.   additionally, unless you plan on putting someone under general anesthesia and using a bone saw to cut a hole in their skull, the easiest way to reach the brain with a sharp object would be through the eye socket, as they used to do for prefrontal lobotomies. in addition to there being risk of damaging the muscles and eyeball itself, there is also the risk of damage to tear ducts (leading to eye infections and other complications) and introducing pathogens into the blood stream and brain, which is obviously not great.   my recommendation: not worth trying!@ not exclusively. my parents have an elderly lab who lately spends most of his days snoozing in sunbeams around the house -- but he can still hear the cheese drawer in the fridge open from across the house and up the stairs, and he will sprint all the way there. if you want out of the kitchen after that you must pay the cheese tax to the dog.@ me before this episode, looking at casting for the season: \"i'm not sure about this, i don't want this to become just an extension of tcw/rebels in live action.\"   me after this episode: when do we get to meet eveyrone else in live action i'm psyched.@ he's written a bunch of them but there's been a bunch of different directors. bryce dallas howard directed this one.@ i'm about to rewatch ep 3 just for the music.@ o7 thank you for your service, dear cat!@ fat tire is my default beer. nothin' remarkable about it, just a good, refreshing beer.@ even *if* someone somehow managed to overlook a large incision from highly invasive surgery, which would have been at least partly/entirely on his front, and would have without a surgical drain been oozing and dripping with discharge, and would have been *extremely* painful without pain management, and would have had obvious sutures or staples -- it still didn't happen.   in the best possible scenario a kidney is viable for about a day and half after being removed from the donor. this assumes a competent transplant team removes it and, within a sterile field, flushes the organ with a preservative solution, bags it up to keep it sterile, puts it on ice, and carefully manages the temperature (you don't want it to actually freeze, nor get too warm).   for a transplant to be successful, you need to match the donor and recipient in a number of ways including not just blood type but tissue typing (usually looking at lymphocytotoxic crossmatching and hla crossmatching). the first type of tissue typing in particular basically tells you that if it's not a good match the recipient's body will pretty much immediately reject the transplanted organ and they will very likely die. so stealing someone's kidney would require, at a minimum, obtaining several tubes of blood from them without their noticing in advance and conducting highly specialized lab tests to ensure there's a point to this.   once the tests are complete, the bad guys would have to, obviously, knock the patient out somewhere discrete, conduct a 2-3+ hour operation, package up the kidney and get it to the recipient (again, a very time-sensitive thing), prep the recipient for surgery, and implant the new organ, all without anyone noticing.   didn't happen.@ lotl in a botl! i love it!@ he's shared fan art and videos of himself telling dumb mando jokes and stuff -- he doesn't seem like someone who's just fulfilling a contractual obligation. he seems genuinely excited to be part of it, so if there was any real disagreement, i doubt it was significant.@ assuming this is asked in good faith: many people who are trans or otherwise gender non-conforming put pronouns in their bios and such, but many cisgender (non-trans) people do it too as a way of normalizing it, so seeing it doesn't automatically make someone \"other\" and also, because it may not always be obvious what pronouns someone uses! maybe they absolutely look like they use he/him, but they actually prefer they/them for whatever reason!   again assuming it's said in good faith, your phrasing of \"normal dude\" is pretty offensive. the world isn't divided into \"normal\" (cisgender and heterosexual) and \"abnormal\" (everything else), it's divided into way too many categories and combinations to list here. being told you're \"not normal\" just for how you identify feels pretty bad.@ this happened to a friend of mine at an interview for his first job out of college at some high-end financial firm. on his way into the office.   thankfully an elevator arrived seconds later so he just set the handle down against the wall, got in the elevator, ignored all calls from that company and entirely changed career fields.@ i have no idea if it would be tested for in an autopsy or if it would leave visible signs, but untreated hiv/aids can lead to wasting syndrome, where someone can lose a huge amount of weight very quickly.   his decision to just walk away from his life and walk the trails could potentially fit with a reaction to a life-changing diagnosis. just go and be in nature until the end?   regardless, i do think that he intended to die one way or another. it doesn't seem like he was planning or wanting to go back to his life.@ you're totally right about the outback - that, for example, is how the japanese doomsday cult aum shinrikyo made and tested chemical weapons with absolutely no one knowing - banjawarn station, where they had set up, is over 1500 square miles and, per wikipedia, is the seventieth-largest cattle station in the country.@ oh god i just had a minor heart attack thinking herzog had died.@ oh that makes a lot of sense!@ i was really surprised they were introducing him so soon in the first episode of the season. but then they weren't! (but then they did).@ car wash?@ i've lived in several countries including germany, and in the american southwest (new mexico). one thing americans and australians have in common is it's *very* hard to express to europeans just how big and empty and harsh parts of america and australia are. germany is one of the larger countries in europe at about 138,000 square miles; death valley np is about 5,000 square miles.   in new zealand, a kiwi once asked me as we were talking about the us if washington state was near colorado. i wasn't sure how to answer -- i mean, it sure is, compared to, say, new york or florida, but at the same time it's well over a thousand miles. many countries just don't have the same scale as the us.   can you get fatally lost in the wilderness in germany (or elsewhere in europe)? of course. but by and large, europe is *much* more densely populated, with much smaller expanses of uninterrupted nature. if you are used to that, it's reasonable to unconsciously assume that if you get in trouble on a remote road, someone -- maybe another tourist, maybe a farmer, whoever -- will be by in, like, a day. but in reality, out in places like death valley, if you drive down what looks like a remote road on a map, you may be the only person for months or *years* to go that way. but there's no way of knowing that looking at a map; if it looks like a road -- or if you take a wrong turn, like it looks like they did -- it's a road. it's very likely they *did* do the smart thing and sit in as much shade as possible and wait, but in a place like death valley it can be a very, *very* long wait.@ this hurts my brain.@ being so handsome is very serious business.@ if, prior to last year, anyone had ever asked me if i thought there was a perfect place for werner herzog in the star wars universe i would have told them they were insane. but it was such perfect casting.@ i had a conversation with some people on discord - reasonable people, not obviously children. the topic of the 9/11 attacks came up.   two people in the conversation not only didn't remember it but weren't even born in september 2001. another was in kindergarten. i was in high school.@ seriously. remember when *that* was the crisis? who would have thought we'd look back on impeachment hearings as a gentler, more innocent time?@ senate impeachment hearings.@ work from home. study from home. play ukulele. read. play video games. chat with friends.@ up means more. turning the ac up means make it colder, turning the heat up means make it warmer, turning the volume up means make it louder@ i was a c student in ib classes in high school. my parents wouldn't let me take easier classes. went to college, dropped out for a year, went back, graduated with a 2 something gpa.   joined the army to pay off my loans, got out, spent some time traveling and figured out what i actually care about. i'm more working in my chosen field (the pay sucks but i love it) and and am finishing up my masters. i have been a straight a student throughout this degree.  i just needed to figure out what i cared about (and also psych meds and therapy) and for me, i needed some real world experience for it. i think i would have been *much* better off taking time off to work and travel right after high school: at that age i had no earthly idea what i wanted nor how to even figure it out, which is fine because i was only 17.@ i've had breasts for about twenty-three years now, and not once have they done anything i could possibly describe as \"jostling\". jiggled in response to my movement? sure! bust jostling conjures up an image of bumper cars and i'm extremely glad that's not happening on my chest.@ when we were young and very stupid, my friends and i tried this only with a shopping cart instead of a toy car. it ended with groundings, losing car privileges, and all of us chipping in to cover the cart riders' emergency dentist visit.@ i'm super impressed by that response time! it's like a light switch gets flipped and she's in work mode just like that. what an incredibly good girl!@ my parents' lab mystery mix is so good motivated that he and my parents accidentally trained each other into feeding him his breakfast on the go.. when they were doing leash training he got a piece of kibble after every good command. now he'll just sulk and try to go back home if you don't bring a training pouch of kibble along on the morning walk (he gets his first piece for being calm getting the gentle leader on).   he's now 13 and really slowing down, but can still hear the cheese drawer open from anywhere in the house!@ she's so clever and excited to help and her coat is so shiny! what a wonderful dog.@ i came in here to say that! i'm sure she has some little dog booties to protect her feet.@ a good way to ensure no one wants to put it in their mouth.@ the best snuggle buddy i can imagine!@ her case is one that i've never felt the need to dig into. those who loved her no doubt take solace in the idea that she was killed trying to save others. it's been 19 years, so if she didn't die and is somewhere out there it's clear she doesn't want to reconnect and provide answers.   i just feel like in this one case it's best to let the dead stay dead, so to speak.@ i recently saw \"extra strength\" saline nasal spray at the store, which is likewise not possible.@ congrats, bro!@ bring back the belly roll!@ i thought i was broken for most of my teens and early 20s and vividly recall the moment at age 22 when i discovered asexuality is a real thing and i am not broken!   that's why i get stupidly excited whenever i see any ace representation anywhere - no one should spend those developmental years assuming that they are somehow broken or missing something essential.@ > the air from the high altitudes and open fields is so fresh but the sun will scorch you to oblivion w/o sunscreen  as a very pasty white kid who went to college in santa fe, this is true of much of the state. absolutely beautiful, and will burn my skin to a crisp extremely quickly.@ quick, is anyone here a doctor? *looks pointedly at op*@ i don't have a link, but he talked about getting the role at i think celebration, and it was very clearly \"kid who grew up on star wars getting his dream job and being overwhelmed with joy\". zero percent diva.@ what a handsome lad ham is! happy birthday to him!@ i'm sure flapjack was every bit as sweet as her name.@ this a million times. not one creep has told me \"smile, honey\" since march, which is undoubtedly the longest stretch since i was a \\*very\\* young teenager.@ oh as a teenager, i was clearly not ok, and the very new-agey therapist my parents took me to \"diagnosed\" me as being a \"highly sensitive person\".   i have finally gotten a *good* therapist and it turns out yes i'm a sensitive and empathetic person (if someone in the room is upset it's hard for me to not get upset), but i also my brain doesn't work in a typical fashion (ptsd, adhd, depression, anxiety, all of which i white-knuckled through, un-diagnosed and untreated, until my 30s!)   finding out that depression, anxiety, and ptsd can all manifest as irritability, and that adhd is linked with difficulty in regulating emotion was all eye-opening. having one little thing that seems insignificant push me over the edge and not understanding why? getting so easily upset at what i could in a sense acknowledge as insignificant problems (\"i can hear you chewing\")? having a really hard time connecting with other people? all linked to greater \"malfunctions\" in my brain. those sudden rushes of intense emotion? adhd can do that, even in adults!   i wish i'd sought out a good therapist when i was 18, instead of wasting my 20s trying to just power through it. but i made it through.@ from one of casteel's appeals:   > chief sneed testified that officers at the command post learned from individuals they > interviewed that they had heard shots on the night of july 9. these individuals also warned > the officers to be careful because if they went onto the petitioners property, he would hold > a shotgun on them. he said that some of these witnesses were able to identify the petitioner > by name but that others were not. he said this was the first time he heard the petitioners > name. he said the authorities met with the owners of property near the helican gate. he > said that despite the walden family claiming ownership of the gate area and witnesses stating > that the petitioner was the only person who posted no trespassing signs in the area, the > confrontations the witnesses alleged having with the petitioner had taken place at the helican > gate.  so there was a gate, there were \"no trespassing\" signs, and it was known that casteel was the one who put them up.   this *obviously* does not justify any act of violence, and i'm certainly not speaking in casteel's defense - what he did was indefensible.   however, it's dishonest to make it sound as if it was a case where some guys accidentally wandered onto private property once and were immediately gunned down. it sounds like there was a persistent problem with litter, and atvs can do a *tremendous* amount of damage to trails that aren't very specifically designed and maintained for them. again, none of this in any way justifies even threatening anyone with a shotgun, but it's a bit more nuanced than \"oh these poor innocent folks didn't even know,\" when in fact they did know they shouldn't have been there.  @ i work in public health and am acutely aware that in terms of death toll there's been the equivalent of about 64 9/11 attacks since february and it's still not under control. and a lot of my friends and former coworkers are still furloughed or have lost their jobs~  plus the incredibly obvious displays of police brutality across the nation. i know it's not a new problem, but as a white person i find it much more visible.   plus the devastating fires out west, not to mention the fires earlier this year in australia, and what they indicate in terms of the way our climate has irreversibly changed.   so~yeah, i think all bad things maybe feel worse on top of everything else this year.@ happy birthday! he looks like an absolute sweetie.@ enby maybe trans (idk i'm old but still figuring shit out) ace here. there's at least two of us!@ i am ace. i was in my 20s by the time i learned it's a thing and that i was not just some broken freak. i spent years trying to be something i'm not and experience something i don't feel, and assuming there was something deeply wrong with me.   the idea that a teenager today can just casually watch something mainstream and see this brings tears to my eyes, because that means there's going to be kids who watch this and say \"oh, whoa, that sounds like me\" and they'll learn that they are not alone and not broken.  representation matters so. much.@ hey sure it's 2020, let's mess with the 13 sealed coffins that amazingly have been entirely untouched for 2500 years, what could go wrong?  in all seriousness, that's an awesome discover.@ you can see the trust and love in her eyes.@ it sounds to me less like a prank and more like straight up harassment. a friend actually had a similar situation -- a very unhappy ex kept sending electricians, plumbers, etc to their house for \"quotes\". it sucks for the people coming out, because that's time and mileage they could be spending on a real job. it sucked for my friend, who had a tree surgeon come out to assess a tree in their yard at 9 am on a saturday (and they rented at the time, too). confirming an order for 50 cases of tequila -- not the peak of hilarity but whatever, but when it's repeated and potentially hurting others' business, it's not very funny.@ oh my goodness he is cute!@ all three of you are absolutely adorable, and this makes my queer dog-loving self so happy. happy anniversary!@ check out  which is run by the city. you'll be connected to a counselor who can do a quick screening about what issues he's experiencing, where in the city you are, and what insurance you have, and they can give you a list of therapists who accept that insurance! you'll need to confirm with the therapist office, of course, but i've used it and it makes it a lot more manageable.@ oh what a sweet baby! that little pink nose is adorable.@ traditionally many herding dogs had their tails docked to avoid injury - they can work in crowded conditions, so to speak, and injuries to the tail can easily get infected and take a long time to heal. that's why it became the breed standard for some breeds. i can't personally justify why non-working dogs have their tails docked, it's an aesthetic decision people make.@ clearly! please tell her i think she's a very good girl.@ what a noble face!@ this. i strongly suspect a white guy in 1998 was not the first to discover this. in fact i suspect the people who built the pyramid and considered that bird sacred were well aware of it!@ i'm so sorry for your loss. i guess my question really should be 'how do i find a way to share his interest'.@ i'm sorry for you loss. i am absolutely trying to enjoy every moment i have with both my parents.@ i think part of it is that i'm definitely *not* interested in ever having a yard or even garden of my own (among other issues i have horrible allergies to just about anything that grows, including grass). the question of how he learned it is interesting, though! i'll definitely bring that up next weekend. he spent most of his childhood in an apartment so it's actually a great question.@ that's the thing - i'm aware of it and trying to enjoy the moments, it's just hard when it's the same topic with no apparent end in sight.@ i'll definitely try and reframe it that way. i'm probably underestimating how hard the past couple months have been on him -- my need for social interaction has always been extremely low and his is definitely higher. and, yeah, payback is fair play as well!  i love the idea of encouraging him to start sharing it on social media more. he's pretty tech savvy and since they're still in the same house i grew up in, it would probably be cool for all of us if he documented everything he's doing.@ i'm sure it wasn't much older (maybe the 80s at the earliest) based on the plot point of a female doctor. i've looked through the list of hugo and nebula nominees from that era and don't recognize any titles, but can't find a summary for a lot of the stories, so i can't definitively rule out it having been nominated.@ awesome job! i'm going through the exact same thing - doing it 30 minutes at a time to keep it from getting overwhelming. here's to feeling better, day by day!@ i hate to say it, but if someone is cooking meth and possibly involved with a cartel in any way, and they go missing, it's pretty easy to guess what happened. someone got mad or felt cheated or so on, killed him, and dumped the body, probably in the delaware.@ don't apologize! that's worth celebrating - great job! i hope your future is happy and healthy.@ i don't personally believe in the foul play theory (i think people tend to \\*seriously\\* underestimate how easy it is to get in trouble in the woods, especially terrain that has lots of thick vegetation and is unfamiliar), but i 100% agree that the \"mysterious\" photos were an attempt to signal a helicopter or other searchers. if all you have is a camera, and you're lost in the woods, and you maybe hear a helicopter overhead or voices nearby, you're going to use whatever you can to try and get their attention.@ i am debt free, get disability payments from the va, and can in no way afford even the cheapest of studios. granted, i'm in nyc, but i get paid nyc wages.@ that's fair! it's not my thing and i've never seen sfw stuff along those lines.@ i totally agree.  the very loose and messy lgbtqia+ community is about *identity*, not specific sexual practices. i'm sure there are people who are into anything i can imagine (like for sure, i'm ace) - but that's not the *primary* way they fit into the community.@ correct me if i'm wrong but it's still considered erotic, right? i mean, you wouldn't decorate your desk at work with photos of it, right?  i'm not denying that there can be artistry to it, but not all art is appropriate for all venues.@ she is the first senator to have a baby while in office (not physically in the senate chamber). she was also the first senator to bring her infant with her - i believe she was breastfeeding and had to be there for a vote. the senate had to vote to change the rules as previously children were not allowed.@ i really wanted cake. so i baked one. it was delicious.\n",
      "hmmm okay, since it's fall i can offer to rake people's lawns, then maybe if we get snow this year i can offer to shovel people out@ but say i did what would be appropriate to charge? $25?@ i'm

i'm happy for you, now just give me some of that luck please@ idk if i should take that as a compliment or not but i've heard that before@ very much gamer@ yes you can do it with just about any ps3 game, look on rpcs3 website to find out more about that, you would have to look for the games community and if they have a private server as the psn servers are down for ps3, like demon souls is the only game i know that has a private server@ against pirating you can emulate but pirating is looked down upon, you can dump the games with a the supported blu ray disc drives on the rpcs3 website and play it that way@ i found a tree feller data pack so i assumed there was a vein miner data pack@ i've gotten that sooo much@ thank you@ thank you@ thanks :)@ the ashen one, he will be mute and can sleep out side@ looks amazing, would like a link for this when it comes out@ cute and love the mcr shirt@ everyone is saying that's when the curtain came down but didn't the curtain fall when hank

love that song, and my buddy got rickrolled not me@ how did you get so many medallions@ what's a mule i keep seeing the term but no.clue what it means@ in those first two videos he doesn't show his build@ i did work a summer job for my pc, my mother covers my phone, i get it, parents want to spoil their child, but i've been raised that life isn't fair, i'm not gonna get everything i want, but he just keeps buying all this shit i don't want, like he always gets me what i want besides my pc@ court ordered to see him, i'm 14 gonna be 15, yes i have problems, i've been dealing with them, it's been hard to come to terms with it, i'm not good with words so that's why i came to reddit for this@ oh so you would be perfectly fine with being forced to see a pedophile?@ i want him out of my life, he's sex offender, we have proof that he's mentally and emotionally abuses me@ because maybe he will grant me my wish to stop seeing him@ lmao@ no i won't, i've prefer to work for my things@ yes most people don't know about it, it's not really am album but an ep, there all so good but beaten in lips or clever black bird session, or hated@ which one, they had one before disgusting. i love all their music@ inception was a great movie, highly under rated@ i prevail is fantastic too, i do prefer aa's older stuff@ beartooth is my all time favorite band, asking alexandria, motionless in white, that's it, any recommendations?@ yeah that's next for me@ maybe@ havnt updated, thanks for reminding me@ started playing the witcher 3 and was like hey i have skyrim, i remember hearing it's super fun too@ i hate this man, i want him out of my life, maybe if he realizes that i don't love him maybe he will let me go@ where do i start, the biggest that he's a sex offender@ idk to be be honest, just lost interest@ it's technically my 2nd but my real first, the \"first time\" i played i stopped at finding out i was dragon borne@ what level should i have been?@ yeah i've done a few side quests but just the main story, are there any side quests that will not be available after i complete the game?@ gladly no, dissapointingly i'm on sword and blood or whatever it's called, i'm completely knew to these games@ i'm down in that elven ruins with keira metz at the beginning of the game@ planned on going the toxic pyro one hit pvp build@ thinking of going pyro@ thanks i was debating that@ so it's pirating?@ what's drm@ is gog galaxy good?@ yeah my step dad told me to try bloodborne and remnant, but i can't get bloodborne on pc@ yes it is i bought ds remastered, i wanna gonna buy ds2 but the mechanics in it look fucked@ i started my journey on june 25 at around 11 pm, i played it for about a week or two and then i took a break and when i came back i finished game, well worth the almost 50 hours it took, time for run #2 this time it's gonna be pvp based build@ hey i'm in the dungeon think you could help me through it?@ i don't remember how to get there@ i don't have that, if you play pc could you help me get to these parts?@ huh?@ thanks man helps alot@ alright@ alright, aldrich and the pass is the same as before mayo@ do you want anything? i feel super bad@ oh wait, just realized i'm out of embers@ do you know any area that drops a large titanite shard i had enough to get it to +4 but i'm one large shard off@ should i reinforce then infuse or infuse then reinforce@ alright@ yeah@ when i go to infuse it, it stays a c@ ah okay is the attribute bonus supposed to change from c to anything?@ and what does infusing it to heavy do?@ where do i get the farron coal? like where in farron@ it's not letting me infuse it with heavy, like it's not giving me the option@ how low is the drop rate of this sword they keep dropping cracked red eyes@ thanks dude@ ah that's the problem, i'm pc@ yeah i'm embered, i still don't see it, what bonfire are you at?@ idk if the pass is case sensitive but it's a capital m@ i don't see it@ my pass is mayo and i'm at  farron keep perimeter@ you got some rusted gold coins you can spare?@ what are the requirements to use it?@ so i just farm those two guys for the sword?@ thanks man@ the pass is mayo@ what's a better weapon then my raw+5 long sword, i'm tired of this@ tf was that monkey thing@ there's a bunch of red eye dudes down there, they are hard, can i just run past them?@ so i ran past those knights, went left, i'm in that church building thing, do i just gun it for the fog?@ do i go for those doors straight ahead?@ i have a +5 long sword i can't fight them@ yeah, i head up those stairs and 2 knights come and rain hell on me@ would of been nice if you told me about those 2 knights@ i don't see anywhere to go once i get up on the top level with the 2 archers@ i don't think you understand where i'm talking about, the archers that are after all those gaints and you gup the stairs there's that illusion wall and then you go up those stairs, i'm talking about those archers@ they shoot me and then while i'm on the ground they shoot me again and kill me@ well just trying to run past them is annoying@ i'm getting my ass kicked by those archers man@ i'm sorry father, i repent for my sin's, o lord forgive me@ alright, thanks@ if they kill me in an area far from a bonfire, then i'll end up losing the 10 to 30k souls i have@ yeah i had just beat pontiff and was past those gaints and a watchdog of farron came in and like 2 shot me@ i think i accidently got rid of the blue covenant oops@ this is my first time playing dark souls, it's very discouraging, how is first time player supposed to fight an experienced player, this is my first time ever playing any dark souls game@ thanks my man, if there is anything i could do to repay you let me know@ it's what it was before@ you've just been commenting on all my stuff

would love to know if i'm over weight@ you truly are beautiful@ it's whatever, he's made his bed now he has to lay in it@ i have a dad buts a dead beat sex offender\n",
      "i don't really trust anyone entering my apartment. there are things that need to be fixed like the microwave and a roach problem that i have just lived with instead of addressing the problems.   i hate hate hate it if someone see who i have become. so i am socially isolated. a hermit in a pile of junk.@ i feel this all the time but in a way i enjoy the sensation. it is all that i have ever known. so i don't really want to heal and feel the regret. i rather just be abandoned, forgotten, and isolated.@ this is pretty true. i plan on leaving my current apartment for another one because of the mess i have accumulated. i am pretty much a hoarder at this point.@ they are just in agreement of what i say: there is little that can be added or corrected.   the dye has been cast and the dice rolled. my life is ultimately over due to the previous traumas of a hoarding home and my inability to recover.   i fear social interaction the most of all. i don't want people to know who i am, it terrifies me.   i am glad we all can see eye to eye: i am a complete waste of life.@ why do you care? my life is over and meaningless. i have nothing to look forward to. the best years of my life are gone.@ i don't believe it is possible for me to ever get a job. that means i have worth and i am a worthless individual. additionally, i had a traumatic brain injury so bright lights are extremely draining. almost every single business - from fast food to office work - uses bright lights. even the machines for more blue collar work have led screens and bright lights.@ yes my dad is an enabler. it always had rules attached to possessions. always obey the hoarding crazy lady.   i have a lifetime of regret and missed opportunities. nothing will ever change. it will just continue to get worse.   the only thing keeping me alive is the thing that won't let me grow.@ > and he will have wasted some of the best years of his life in the hoard with them, trying to help. his 20s are gone now. and for what? so no one has to change and get mental help?   i have wasted the best years of my life due to a hoarding environment. i have given up really. there feels like no point anymore. i will be forever alone as well.   do you have any advice? i tried suicide but that just made me stay in the hoarding home even longer. i am now in an apartment but the only way to get an income is to become a hoarder myself and resell just to survive.@ how can i have job skills if i have never had a job?@ the most important skills are productivity skills; i.e the ability to land a good job. i have basic lifestyles down for the most part (except driving because police are scary and i don't want another concussion).  i guess, i feel aimless because i have not gotten positive response when learning skills. so it feels like getting a job is a mysterious thing.  additionally, getting a fast food job i don't even really qualify that as a job. i did that part-time but they hire anyone, you don't gain any good hard skills, and you are only qualified for more fast food work.   plus the environment of fast food seems toxic and cancer causing.@ what country did you move to?@ > this is a really, really, really shitty plan.  it doesn't have to be the eu. also, it isn't supposed to be a long-term plan. it is trial by fire.   currently, from apathy, my long-term plan just results living a hermit lifestyle until my funds run out in 10+ years and i get kicked out of the apartment to die in the streets.   being dropped into an unknown territory without the ability to manipulate my way out of situations (that's what a common language allows) means nonverbal and discipline are extremely important. each interaction is a learning moment. each behavior is a life or death situation. finally, a test worthy of the gods.  the only thing i have right now are long-term fasts (10+ days) but that gets too routine over time.   >\"wherever you go, there you are\"  yes, my true self. no ability to talk my way out of situations, no ability to depend on my parents, no safety nets, no english language, no fallback. do i survive or do my organs get harvested by china? a man's test.   >get help. make an appointment with your gp, and get a referral to a therapist, and see if you can get an appointment with one near you. therapy can help. you need to deal with your mental health issues before you do anything else.  it depends highly on the therapist. a good therapist, doing once a week appointments at 1 hour in length, costs as much as my apartment rent (rent is $500 a month or $125 per week). plus you can become involuntary committed if you say certain buzz words. they make you take \"medication\" that is a result of population control from mk ultra and the cold war. these pills make you extremely apathetic and people claim this is a cure. it is abusive. therapy was weaponized against me so i made sure to say the politically correct things at all cost.   >this is not good. that closes almost every door to immigration. >get a bachelors degree in something useful (most likely in the us). there's a reason this is second. if you try to do a degree with your mental state, you'll likely fail. and i say that as someone who nearly failed out of my bachelors because of mental health reasons. also, pick a subject that will enable immigration.  i have studied computer science, biology, neuroscience, engineering, and accounting. as soon as i pick something, my interest dies. authority and testing kills it. there are three authorities that tend to control life on the short-term (non-biological): teachers, parents, and bosses.   i don't see myself ever going back to a university, especially since i learn completely different than most people (autism). is a degree really that important? it just feels like that only thing you learn is how to take a test and the fear of cheating (or being accused of cheating).@ how hard is it to get a job?@ well right now i live a hermit lifestyle in an apartment. i had to use my parents' income information (with their permission) to be qualified. they drop off food now and then but i mostly just stare into the blankness and dullness of apathy.   it would be pretty metal to get drop shipped to a foreign country. selected at random. and have no idea if i will survive the night or if china will harvest my organs. it would be the ultimate test.   everyday would be a new adventure. a brutal and unforgiving adventure. like when i was a kid and unsure what english words meant but the teachers would scorn me anyways.@ i tended to get expensive gifts and held on to them to later sell since i was 5 years old. i got paid for grades and performance exams. birthdays i got stocks, watches and gold. one watch went from $500 to $5k due to being hard to find and sold out. it was a lucky thing. but i never got love or a caring family. it was hoarding and enabling. enabling feels like caring until you want to get out of the comfort zone and then the hate piles on. the won'ts, the can'ts, the should nots. \"your mother and i feel like this is too risky, too dangerous, too unsafe, too crazy.\"   i don't drive a car because i have an extreme fear of authority (police). and i never got a job because i cannot get hired after hundreds of attempts (no skills).   the money already lets me live 10+ years in the usa on my current budget. wouldn't the cheaper nations be less expensive? i could also get a rural home and stretch it to 15+ years. or live with a large number of roommates (20+ people).@ well with my current spending (i pay for an apartment but i had to use my parent's income taxes to get approved, so it felt like i was still depending on them), i have at least 10 years of savings in the usa.   wouldn't se asia be cheaper?@ clarification: it doesn't actually have to be the eu. it can be anywhere, but \"anywhere\" was getting spam filtered. also it can't be landlocked to the usa. so mexico, south america, canada won't work (my parents will drive and find me). it needs to be accessed by only international plane.@ cheaper and less risky than a therapist who might mk ultra me.@ you don't have to respond but reddit is naturally addictive.   i want a place or places or situations to vent. nothing ever changes. the idea is drain all my money so that the worse, most miserable existence occurs. because i deserve it.   i am a slut for pity. give me it all. i crave attention. that's why i will never stop posting.   if you don't like it, well, become a fascist and censor me.@ > if you get back in there and dont get motivated, you will eventually kill yourself.   that's fine by me.@ i am a waste of a person.@ living in a hoarding home has permanently damaged my brain structure.@ mental health has been used to weaponize individual thought. they want peaceful slaves instead of dangerous free thinkers.   it is the major issue with the hoarding home. the mental games. out of the pan and into the fire. society enables hoarding. low-key most consumers are procrastination hoarders they just hide it better.@ >  no one can make you take medication.  not true. you can easily be committed against your will and hooked onto medication as the only means to escape. it has happened when i first raged about the hoarding home. and when in a mental ward they can continue to violate your consent in the name of \"this is part of your illness talking.\" i hate it when people touch me. low-key i will stare them down due to my~history.   therapists never look into the environment. first home i lived in had lead pipes~second home i lived in had black mold. fed fast food and was 220 pounds at the age of 10. constantly picked on. no friends. no sexual interest. not one therapist said \"you know, these things feel like red flags.\"   i had to learn things the hard way but the home set me off and with no direction of escape. but a concussion/tbi was grounding in a sense i just wanted to heal and still just want to heal.   nothing in society is actually healing that i have found. it is just lip service for the veil of \"productivity.\"   >you have to want to live for yourself if for no other reason than spite, you have to want it and take action.   don't really want to live. i missed all the important milestones that makes a socially functional person. i am a defective human being.@ i have 9 years of savings because i sold gifts and other valuables from the hoarding mess.   it isn't like i have transferable skills and my head has extreme memory problems. i used to bash my skull on the junk and over time created a nasty concussion/tbi.  i am a waste of human existence.   and yes i want pity. i want attention. because i never got it. i only got useless materialistic junk. i never felt \"love.\" i never felt wanted as a person. i never felt any of these things. never.   so no, i will continue to post my pity because it is the only thing i got left.@ i stopped blaming people. i just sleep and browse the internet. eventually i will be kicked out of my apartment to rot in the streets.   the sad thing is i cannot even remember living in the hoarding home. what finally got me out was getting a concussion/tbi and needing a place to rest. my memory is messed up. it is very selective and tends to occur when i am dreaming.   every time i get fomo (fear of missed opportunities) i post on here or think about posting. but now i have no more opportunities.@ i don't see how a mental hospital will help when 1. i don't leave my apartment and 2. i am anti-psychiatry.   i am going through withdrawal from previous addictions and so sleeping has become the \"main\" addiction instead of porn or video games. a mental hospital will just cause more dopamine issues and they will create another substance abuse with their chemically imbalancing \"medication.\"   the lack of consent and the specific \"mold\" that everyone must fit is a huge issue as well. mental hospitals can easily check you in but getting out is much harder. there have been numerous examples of a medical professional going into one undercover and getting labeled as \"insane.\" if he said it was just an experiment and no need to worry, he has his papers, etc, the \"doctors\" would just say this is part of his delusions and to take his \"treatment pills.\"   they are making normal human emotions into diseases. i am lonely and lack community. a mental ward will make it even worse.@ did you have a massive amount of shame and a nostalgia for the past to keep sleeping to get more and more dreams of a better time period? a time where there was hope, social abundance, and opportunities?@ yeah probably at least physically. i am somewhat underweight. the main issue is that i have been a hermit for at least 9 months now while \"on my own.\" i never leave the apartment and my parents drop off supplies/groceries now and then. shame.@ yes, fear and shame. i am not a well adjusted person. i have been a hermit for years. i only knew about the pandemic due to reddit but i have been in self- isolation for longer.  there isn't anything to look forward to besides working a low paying job forever.@ i have cptsd, avoidance & addictive personality, and self-isolate due to my shame. i have become addicted to sleeping due to my dreams of being around 19 and socializing. and my only purpose and goal was to clean the hoarding home from a crazy stuff person. of course i am mentally ill as well, it runs in the family. a defective person.  do you know how many years it has taken me to complete my driving exam i started at 18 (the one i sit with a state police officer) after passing the written exam? trick question, i never did it. i am too nervous of police so my license still requires a person 21 and over to supervise me.   no car = no job = no hope = self isolation. the recent protests have made me even more nervous of police. 9 years until i am fully homeless. it is what i deserve.@ my only purpose, my only desire, was to clean the hoarding home. i feel lost without it. i live 100% like a hermit. i don't want people to know who i am. it is better if i faded.@ i am stuck and i am sad. my life was robbed from me. only low income jobs and isolation are what i am qualified for and so i just sleep. because my dreams are the best time machines. when there was hope and opportunities.  6 months is nothing when on a loop. i have 9 more years of savings so i can loop for a lot longer. my parents drop off groceries and i send them paypal. i never leave my apartment.   i am a failure. i never left the hoarding home when i was supposed to and now i have not adjusted to society.   the idea of finding a motivational community, a good job, and a girlfriend are slim to none at my current age and level of worthlessness. i have already aged myself out of the equation. once my money runs out i will see if there is purpose to being homeless or move back into the hoarding home.   there isn't anything to live for.@ i think the issue are withdrawal symptoms. when coping in the hoarding home, i had several addictions that are now removed. video games, watching shows, food, porn, and the authority of most rules. reddit is still hit and miss, hard to stop using it 100%.   so now, my biggest vice is sleeping due to the dopamine hit i get when i dream. my dreams are incredibly vivid and emotional. i immediately feel like i have known the people for years or have an immediate connection.  it is a dopamine crash that affects my motivation. \"maybe one more dream~\"\n",
      "i literally did the same thing today. 10 pages due at 6 pm today. started at noon and finished by 5 pm!   mine paper was on robert oppenheimer and his influence. you can do it!@ yup, i started out as pharmacy but once i saw that bls stat of -12% job growth, i noped tf out.@ lmao this actually made me laugh@ this is right. the stuff theyre learning in pharmacy school is no different than what i learned my second year of being a bio major. really, cell respiration? really?@ lmao i have homework due for a class after our final. makes no sense@ lmao i said the same thing. they didnt even investigate my stolen bike i reported when there were cameras there and all@ i see, thanks! i'm mainly just worried because i'm trying to graduate and don't want my school withhold my diploma or whatever but i don't think that'll happen. i'd have fronted the 79 cents just to get them to leave me alone but they're being dicks about it so they can eat shit.@ is it still theft? i was genuinely an accident if i even took anything -- and i don't know if i did or not. also i thought you needed proof to file a police report, which they don't have because it may not have even happened.@ my only concern is that my one roommate's, filing the police report (and former best friend) boyfriend is a cop. the other two have parents that are lawyers. wonder what bs they're being fed.@ they've been texting a mutual friend of ours (who is on my side, he's told them to f off) and said if i don't pay up they're in the process of filing right now lmao.  does campus police even have that jurisdiction? i know city police will laugh in their face.@ oh lord no, there's a reason i had to take an extra semester. shit's hard. they think i'm less because they're in pharmacy school, basically doctors already and are god's gift to earth.   they once asked me, \"do you even study? like, biology majors. because our stuff is so hard and we have the study a lot.\"  and yeah hell no, i'm not giving them a penny. maybe if they asked nicely for the amount it's worth i'd have fronted the three quarters and four pennies, but not if they're gonna be dicks about it. they know that i know one of their parents is a lawyer so i should be super scared.  also, these are all women. petty, vicious women.@ played hockey for the majority of my life and can ice skate pretty well and can do inline proficiently. however, as a girl in her early 20s the rollerskating (quad wheels) tiktok trend got to me and i decided to give it a whirl. holy hell, its hard! i ended up breaking my arm on them this summer. totally different.@ ghost!!! @ right. it's just a bummer to me for so many reasons. all the grad schools i applied to for the spring ended up revoking all admissions, so i'm not going to grad school anytime soon because of rona. also, my family left my high school graduation before my name was even called which still hurts me, and it would mean the world to me for them to stay for this one. i guess a shitty iphone picture on a slideshow will have to do.@ that hurts my heart. i truly didn't think i'd make it this far in life~and it's not even celebrated.@ thought the same thing over here. shrugged and went back to sleep.@ idk she's one of those people who are like \"i'm a bitch and proud so deal with it\" it's really quite charming@ problem is, my other two roommates love her! so i'm left to just sit in my room all day. great way to spend my final semester.@ two more weeks left baby. then we're being sent home and i graduate in december! congrats to you on graduating too! microbio was never my strong suit.@ omg thank you! i doubted myself for a second after i got the text and was like \"am i wrong??\" but no, she's just an idiot but won't admit it. sucks because her favorite hobby is to make me feel like a dumbass for being a stupid biology major. \"do you guys even do anything?\"@ it breaks my heart because we have so much in common! we both love sports (she's a big hockey fan, i played hockey most of my life, have season tickets to her favorite team), she's a big star wars fan (i have a storm trooper keychain on my car keys, watch the mandalorian every friday, even watched the animated series), and is in the same field as i am with school (i'm going into pharmacology, she's pharmacy). it's a match made in heaven. but she straight up said as soon as she met me she knew she hated me. so that's cool.@ boooo, i just wanna know if i need to decorate my cap or not! :(@ aw thank you dear! that genuinely warms my heart. good luck to you too :,)@ oh im anemic too!! im constantly cold. she sees me with my layers of clothes on but doesnt give a fuck. ive emailed my ra but i doubt anything will get done. three weeks left.@ probably not gonna make it, were still a block away and theyre done letting people in at 8. good that a lot of people showed up though!!!@ yeah, still in traffic. almost in@ in traffic!@ every time i leave the room they turn the ac on higher. its fucking annoying. i might ask the ra but theres also only 3 weeks left. i just tried cleaning the vents and theres straight up mold in there. thats whats blowing around my apartment.@ yeah! i'm still gonna try and go later in the evening in case they have some spots open. if not we'll just head over to burgatory and get some food, no biggie.@ huh, my friend maybe donated like $10, he's a poor college student at pitt lol. very strange.@ implying that she's paying for it and not her dad lol@ the problem is they're a bunch of narcissistic pharmacy school girls who look down on me for being a biology major. i've told them that cold air actually irritates asthma since it's dry and will make her lungs do more work than if the heat was on. but they say i'm stupid and don't know anything. like~one of them convinced the other to stop taking her antipsychotics because she said she knows more than her psychiatrist. shit like that.  i'm graduating in december so only a few more weeks left, so i'm not going to raise hell with the ra. i've tried asking if i can turn it off when they're not around and they said no. my throat is so dry from the ac on full blast all the time and i have to wear gloves to type.  i'm trying to find someone to sublease my apartment (since my lease is for the entire year and i graduate soon) but my roommates sabotage it every time and scare the potential subletter away when there's hardly anyone available in the first place. so i'm going to be paying $7,000 for a room i'm not living in.@ no idea how much he donated. i think it's one of those cases if you signed up for a newsletter (like i still get bernie mail because i went to a rally a few years ago). i'm still going to try and go closer to 8 pm when the gates close in case there's still room. if not, no harm done!@ interesting, thanks! i might still try to go closer to the time check in closes in case theres still room. if not, no harm done.@ my friend got an email because he donated or something and it says 1 invitee and 1 guest per car. i dont get it, isnt the point of a political rally to get as many people there as possible, in this case in a vehicle?@ right, i also hear its invite only whatever that means@ do you know what time? id love to go~honestly just to see gaga lmao.@ what time?@ i too work in butler. what a terrible place.@ if you ever need help feel free to pm me!! im a senior biology major graduating this fall. i specialize in physiology.@ im doing pharmacology in grad school. a bio degree is useless unless you keep going. i did find a gig at the aviary that requires a bio degree~but its $10/hr lmao@ it gets better  xoxo, senior biology major@ she sounds like a bratty teenager and def not mature enough to be doing any of this lol.@ ive been making a celebrity death pool every year since 2018. i make them every january 1st and i can honestly say i did not intend on regretting not writing trumps name down. i did get one point off rbg though.@ do you~know what college is?@ if med school is your plan, dont do psychology, you wont be taking any classes or learning anything required for your mcat. psych is a liberal art, not a science. it requires papers and regurgitating theory while biology is more learning lab skills and applying your knowledge.  psych is a lot of reading and papers. biology is more studying and studying and crying and doing lab work. both are hard, but if you want to do med school, psych is useless as a major. as a minor though, very useful! however, there is a reason why most biology majors drop and do psychology.  example, as a psych major, a lot of your classes will look like: into to psych, sociology, childhood development, etc.  whereas a biology major, your classes will look like: general biology, organic chemistry, cellular and molecular biology.  what do you think will help you pass your mcat?  source; senior biology major.@ sid is notoriously very private about his life. i wouldnt be surprised if he was married and had kids but no one knew.@ lmao because everyone has struggled with the krebs cycle, its just pure memorization and honestly the most complicated thing ive learned as a bio major. dont sweat it!@ lmao trust me, one of my jokes to myself is im illiterate. im a giant dumbass most of the time.  so whats youre describing sounds like the krebs cycle / cell respiration to me with all the complex processes, inputs, and outputs. cell bio is a bitch, nobody knows how that shit works, trust me. and if they say they do theyre lying, ask any doctor how the electron transport chain works and theyll tell you to get the fuck out.  basically, the key to understanding bio is drawing things out and rewriting notes. if your prof gives you a powerpoint, rewriting the notes in your own words helps a ton because its forces you to internalize it. also redrawing the complex pictures. i make them pretty so that its fun when i draw them :) then before a test, just do a giant brain dump onto a page, basically throwing everything you know about the subject down and then once youre done, add to it and study that.@ well, we're on campus in an apartment so we're stuck together. she texted me today while in class and said it's not her job to tell me every time she has her camera on and to stop changing in my room~.like excuse me did i read that right.@ i dont care not because im confident, but because someone walking around naked in her camera is more embarrassing to her than me  they know who she is and im just some random girl in the background with low res titties.@ hey, senior biology major here. dm me if you need any help, seriously.@ imagine using your computer to jerk off.  lol just messing with ya but come on..who doesn't use their phone.@ yeah, that's why i thought it was okay to strip. guess not and now 200 people have seen my ass and titties.@ maybe not 200 but, definitely a hefty amount. at least 50 because some people have multiple people on one camera.@ yeah she blows. she doesnt look me in the eye if she ever has to say something to me and avoids me at all costs lol. i genuinely try to be nice to her but whatever.@ we can leave campus to go shopping but we have to be with our roommate which can be difficult to plan around. basically if they find out we left campus to see friends or family they have and will suspend us. it's a bit whack.@ yeah we can go outside but it's been raining almost every day here unfortunately which is no one's fault. but we can't leave the premises of the campus which leaves..about nothing to do. it certainly doesn't help for classes either, i've never been so unmotivated in my life. just nothing to look forward to.@ i say this in the most loving, supportive way possible~that's a new level of comfortableness hahaha.@ thank you dear!! thats so nice of you and such a refreshing thing to hear after these last awful 24 hours. im going to make an update post tomorrow.@ ugh i wanted to go off on him but i realized thats also how women get murdered lol.@ thats actually a great analogy!! thank you, ill use that.@ literally the entire time this was happening that tik tok soundbite why you goin so fuckin faaaaast??? was playing lmao.  i was literally gagging and tears were in my eye and he kept going.@ lol i did tell him what i thought and how offended i was from what he said. i wasnt nice about it. he hasnt opened it yet. probably knows whats coming.@ thats~a fantastic point lol.@ ha, thank you! im taking the gre soon so im tuning up my writing skills. i dont regret my experience, im just mad is all.@ oh i dont doubt that! i stay humble. but i can just recognize its something im good at because i am receptive to advice. i lurk around here a lot for tips too :)@ oh i wish it was a joke. he's come up my way a few times but nothing ever happened, just hanged. i'm going to call him out on his shit as closure for myself but if he isn't receptive to it i'm just gonna be done.@ i know he's had sex with more people than me, he claims his body count is 9 including me but 5 were drunk sorority girls. but, he's only ever had one long term relationship which i think is telling, so you only get to really know one body. i've had two long term sexual relationships, and had some on and off fooling around with people w/o sex. and yet~i'm the inexperienced one. bitch i'm 22 and a biology major. i know sex and how your body works. men aren't complicated.@ i almost hit a deer on the ride back so no it was not nice haha, his school is out in the middle of nowhere. to make the entire story better, i pulled onto his campus parking lot and i didn't know where i was going and he wasn't very helpful with directions, so i walked around this giant campus for 40 minutes dripping sweat from the 100% humidity before i showed up at his building. it was great. he gave me some water though, what a gentleman.@ ugh@ lmao thank you, i had to write it out or else i was just going to be depressed all day and it helped. i think you're right about frat boys~he said his body count is 8 but five of those were drunk sorority girls which i think should by default knock your experience down a few pegs.@ oh no i'm not hooking up with him again unless somehow he realizes what he did was wrong and wants to work on it, but i don't think his ego will let that happen.@ a short time~being 2 hours. with 200 kids sitting on top of each other. and maybe 1/3 wearing a mask because its not mandated.  but going to the library to sit at a table with a lab partner is too much. i see. schools should have just been shut down imo. theres no point if were just getting sent home anyways. the neighboring school accidentally sent out an email saying students are being sent back in october.@ it wasnt volunteer work lol its literally my job. i just dont see a reason to put these stupid restrictions in schools when a. im being forced to go to in person classes with 200 people packed into a lecture hall, b. im still paying full tuition, and increased at that. and c. were getting sent home in sub six weeks anyways.  youre telling me that i can still go to a 200+ person lecture but cant go to the library or see my friend in another building.@ how many old people have you done nasopharyngeal swabs on and confirmed their positive tests? how sweaty was the hazmat suit for you?@ thank you :)  a covid tester@ exactly that, theres no point in my opinion. i have money on a bet that well be sent home in less than six weeks. might as well let me get the most out of it in the little time i have.  were all going to get it at this point. my sister has it right now and literally never left her house. and my school has the gall to tell me that packing 200 kids in a lecture hall is fine but going to see my boyfriend in his room when weve both tested negative isnt.@ lmao i literally worked at a covid testing site and did swabs this summer, i know what the pandemic is about.   that being said, locking you in your dorm at the school you paid $50,000 a year to attend and not be able to do anything to supplement your education is a scam. just shut down the school.  if youre going to make me attend in person classes at least let me go to the damn library or visit my lab partner in their room.@ its fucking exhausting.@ yeah, four cops couldnt stop a kid from lifting up a huge object and chucking it at the window, and then jumping. sure.@ i was right outside the building when this happened. it was not a party. he was alone in his room after getting into an argument with his roommate and a neighbor called the campus police out of concern. there were four cops in the room with the kid and somehow none of them could stop him from tossing a desk through the windows that dont even open and jumping.@ as a student who was right outside the building when this tragedy happened, i hope she gets help and the peace she deserves. the university certainly didnt handle it the best but just give the woman her demands, they arent too much.@ yeah you definitely need to be ~feelin yourself~ in order to experience any pleasure, let alone orgasm. so you know now that its a mental barrier you have to cross, not a physical one! your boyfriend can help gas you up to feel sexy and all but ultimately its you. buy some cute lingerie, take pics of yourself for your boyfriend in said cute lingerie. youre not broken, it will come in time i promise :)@ i used to have the same exact problem as you, at your age too!! i only just figured it out this year and im 22. do you have any self esteem issues? that turned out to be my main hang up, i didnt find myself attractive and was never in the right headspace to get horny, only when my bf gave me the validation that i was attractive would i feel anything.  it may take some time, but i always found that taking pics/nudes of myself helped hype me up.  also if youre on any anti depressants that can def be the culprit.@ why cant you do it in your room? if youre both virgins itll be pretty quick, honestly. i was your age when i lost my virginity too and we did it on my basement couch. it was like 2 minutes. if you can make out in your room you can pump one out real quick.  if youre that worried, theres positions you can do that makes it look like youre just cuddling.@ i mean, my friend is the product of a vasectomy lol. after she was born her mom def got her tubes tied.@ deadass sent this to a guy after exchanging nudes lmaoooo  the thing is, kronks commentary was pretty spot on anyways.@ lucky, im on the western side of the state and they just said fuck yall meanwhile were surging with cases in pittsburgh@ i hate it here lmao@ i had no idea that was a thing!! damn, that would sure be nice. my tuition has increased over $5k since i started.@ im a girl but ive been on celexa for~7 years i think. it def fucked with my sex drive. in fact i only had my first orgasm this year and im 22. not because i couldnt, i just didnt have the drive.  unfortunately is the sad reality with depression, you can either nut or not want to kill yourself every day. snris like wellbutrin dont have any negative sexual side effects (if anything it increases your libido) but its either hit or miss for people. it turned me into a raging bitch but my friend loves it. talk to your doc about switching meds if youre curious.@ order one for pickup at target! also urban outfitters has them too if you want it delivered so itll just say urban outfitters on the package.  target has~surprisingly good ones. i have the plusone rabbit from there and holy hell. its only $30 and pretty quiet. 10/10.@ you bring up a good point about validation. its a mix of seeking that and being a turn on that he knows what my body looks like. i feel it cant hurt though.   good advice though, i only show my partial face in snaps and no face in pics.@ the answer is none.@ yes. im a kappa psi brother and many bros are also in social frats. you just cant do two socials.@ i believe its original use was to be an anti psychotic but since then, better drugs have been developed. but my point still stands that drugs are commonly used for off label reasons lol.@ right, im sure hes on other stuff on top of lexapro to enhance its effect. i just have only heard him talk about being on lexapro before.@ yeah and wellbutrin is one of the most commonly prescribed anti depressants and yet it turns me into a raging bitch. topamax is an anti seizure but i take it for depression to complement my celexa. compazine is an anti psychotic commonly used for dementia patients but i use it for nausea. drugs arent a one size fits all situation.   i know what pharmacists do lol, youre wrong, they do have prescribing rights in some states. they also dont just count the pills, they correct all the fuck ups your dr makes, if were talking about retail settings. pharmacists do more than work at cvs, you know.   if he doesnt take his meds because it makes him less creative then thats incredibly selfish.@ im a pharmacy student. you can be prescribed lexapro for bipolar depression.@ he has serious bipolar disorder and wont go back on his lexapro.@ me too :( thought i dodged a bullet by not graduating on time but looks like our commencement will be zoom too.@ omg! youre a ky brother and youre doing my dream job! i aspire to be you.@ right, im from pittsburgh. damn quakers ruining shit.@ wait, not every state as liquor stores and beer distributors separate?@ ha! of course! what do you need help with?@ thats a senior living community@ welp, that sucks. damn.@ theyre addressed in my name, as they were my sisters when she got her check. he cant cash them if theyre in my name. and if they were for the care of me, they definitely werent allocated to me.@ im in kappa psi and attend national pharmaceutical conferences twice a year, so networking is good! also was a lab assistant in a pharmacology lab. research just seems to be for me.@ yes, i know theres industry, hospital, etc. but you know who also believes theyre too good for retail and dont want to even touch it? every single person in my would-be pharmacy class. there isnt enough non retail jobs to go around and when student loans come knocking at your door because you cant find a cushy non-retail job, youre going to take that cvs floater position for a whopping $35/hr.@ same lol dont feel bad. im going into pharmacology now, fuck pharmacy school.@ yup, this sub made me change career paths and im grateful for it. im in a pharmacy frat (ky) and my big graduated two years ago and still is unemployed.   im shooting on going to grad school for pharmacology so i can do research.@ welp, i couldn't be less surprised. i love my job so much but damn do i have corporate with a burning passion. it's like being strung along by an abusive boyfriend.@ thank you love  im going to try my hand at the unemployment office tomorrow. i really would like to work again though, anywhere. im so bored! i got an interview at a medical marijuana dispensary and i was so excited, but they never called back :(@ wow, really? i'm from pa, i wouldn't be surprised. i'm definitely calling tomorrow. can't wait to be on hold for four hours lol.@ back in may lol. they give you a credit card that has you unemployment money deposited into it and i keep checking every week and see $0. like why send me a card if i'm denied?@ i asked my orthopedist and he said with elbow breaks you're actually supposed to splint it for a few days, which i did, and then remove the splint so that it can get exercise. i know, it's wild to me too lol. still hurts like a bitch if i put pressure on it, i must have looked like an idiot carrying 4 pizzas to my car with one hand.@ pittsburgh area@ yes, please let me know! i don't know why i didn't get anything because i know people who worked maybe one day a week and still qualified for the $600. i just texted my manager asking if he has a timeframe of all when i can come back and he said there's only 90 tech hours to go around between the five of us, so obviously the full time people are getting the chunk of it and none left for me~  i'm calling the unemployment office tomorrow to see if there's anything i can do.@ i feel :( i'm part of the 1% that genuinely loves my job too~sometimes i just stop into the store to say hi because i miss them all so much.@ i've reached out to four different stores in the area, and everyone seems to have the same idea as me so they had no hours to give. even the store that literally has two techs couldn't give me hours.  i just texted my manager today and he said between the five of us techs at my store, he has 90 tech hours to give and can't give me a piece until it gets better. i don't think it's getting any better.@ thank you for your sympathy. id do a lot for 40 hours right now. hell, i even offered my coworker money to take her shift. its nuts because im actually the 2nd most experienced tech at my store but since im part time from being in school, i was the weakest link i guess.@ yup thats exactly what i did. i know people who worked less than me and got the $600 and i got nothing. my state is done giving out money on the 25th apparently. im going to try calling tomorrow. i just cant go on like this man, im door dashing with a fuckin broken arm rn.@ tried, got nothing@ thank you! ive always been afraid to contact them as my family has all had bad experiences with the office at the begging on the pandemics. i hope to god another stimulus check is sent out that includes college students because i wasnt eligible for the first one.@ exactly  i really think corporate is trying not to fire people or else they have to chip into paying unemployment for hundreds of people@ ive tried actually. i applied and said my hours got cut and they didnt give me anything. i dont know if i did something wrong or if i didnt work enough in the first place. i only worked two days a week since id generally be in school during the week. but money is money and even one day a week would help so much.@ i know~hes a good guy otherwise and is the type to stand up for his techs. i wondering if corporate is telling managers to pause on firings so they dont have to pay unemployment.@ hey! senior bio major here graduating in december. i had kind of the same issue. i transferred after my freshman year and my credits were all messed up. ended up taking calculus, ochem, and physics all in one semester and i failed 2/3. my gpa was shot and i got put on academic probation. eventually i worked my way up and as long as youre around a 2.7 by the end, apply to grad school. research jobs are always aplenty and pa school is over saturated and not worth it imo, nps do more with less schooling.  also, theres no shame in graduating late. all of the seniors in my research lab last semester were late grads, either by a semester or a year. its pretty normal for stem majors to take longer.@ yup, december grad here. i thought a dodged a bullet by not graduating in may like i was supposed to. i guess its just gonna be more of the same.@ hey!

and the pressure of monetizing your publishing, in real-time?  i'm not the same person every day. there's been \"gaps\" as i complete my own project. but each time i've come back to it, it's been with a new perspective. i gain increased understanding of what i'm writing.   look how many people lament they have good writing ideas, but can't seem to get started.   my 2 cents, you've become expert in starting. finishing is a different skill you'll have to master, just as you did with starting. you haven't failed, you just need to learn a new skill.  how much content - how many series, can you realistically juggle, as long-term projects?  consider being candid with your supporters. ask them which series they most want to see completed right now.    writing the ending may have things to teach you regarding your feelings about it. will you be afraid?

getting good grades is a win in itself. learning self-discipline, goal-setting and delayed gratification is good for a steady, orderly brain. you'll never regret self-care.@ i'd offer that consumers aren't going to want to pay prices for first-world workers. they can't- consumers themselves aren't paid for their own labor. the entire floor has to be raised for all if manufacturing is to resume in the us. and corporate profits and executive compensation be brought back in line. will voters and policymakers approve such sweeping structural changes?@ siri. genius playlists.@ travel west from burbank to north hollywood. huge difference in road surfacing and striping. , with burbank being immaculate. large parts of north hollywood are without sidewalks or even shoulders on some streets, yet its housing density has been high since the late '60's when much of the apartment buildings were thrown up.   who is responsible for letting this slide for so long?@ if audible wants to build a lending club, that's a different business model than stealing from content creators with a \"sale\" that isn't a sale.   if audible had to carry the royalty costs i'm curious what their model would look like.@ **i wholeheartedly support your idea.** there was a brief time when a person could have a job for life~ entrepreneurship is the only way to stay employed in my view. the only support i know of for this age group was eagle scouts and i may have bad data on that.   when i was 8 years old, my 9-year old friend and i got the idea to make a little product and sell it door to door. we made a nice little profit. from that i learned r&d, teamwork, marketing and sales strategy -and those lessons fueled my idea of what i can do.   i'd lean more towards education featuring  bootstrapping, over starting with funding, and i'd teach awareness of one's transferable skills. fire those brains up.@ i think a lot of developers were allowed to quickly toss up buildings while the city cut corners. if you ever hear what caused it, hmu!@ check out the refurbished deals on apple's own website. there's generally a couple month's lag time before the newest machines become available. most often seen are previous-gen machines. learn which models can be upgraded with additional ram- this has changed recently.   apple-refurbished will have been throughly inspected and will ship with new cables, etc and a factory warranty, which can be extended just like new. they ship for free. the only way you'll be able to tell its not brand new is the box it ships in is plain. the serial number is coded to let a tech know it's refurbished.  they appear and disappear from the site pretty quickly so keep an eye peeled. years ago, i saved $500 on my desktop mac- this is an unusually-high amount. it's common to see about $250 savings.@ another workflow. my one-back version of scrivener said, export to pages in word .doc. i then tried to conform it to master pages i'd made in the pages app and my cpu went to 100. i'm sure it's trying to remember all those changes. i think if i export from scrivener in their \"as-is\" to my pages\\* master pages, i might be successful. longing for indesign. i cut my teeth on pagemaker.  \\*name your programs with an eye to workflow conversations~@ i skimmed editors on fiverr a few months ago. what i saw described as \"editing\" seems to be what you are wanting to offer (in your amended remarks)@ i wondered if apps were directing commuter traffic to these neighborhood arterials. they weren't designed for high-volume and a half-mile would create new bottlenecks where they merge back into the older design.  noho needs sidewalks!@ )@ wow!

(short week (in us) next week, with holiday coming up- try to make calls like this now.) does your fianc take meds and did he do so today? he's surely processing a waterfall of emotions as he's working. it may make it hard for him to communicate with you. *it's not your fault.* understand, you can't fix this. try to take your cues from him.  if you've got a dr and/or a therapist, get in

i'm curious how many of life's errands she accomplishes without making her husband run interference for her.  what gripes me here is, i'm her same age and gender. i used schematics as a kid and learned to code in the '80's.  i've advised people in building and racking complicated communications systems. yet i walk into a store alone and i'm (initially) processed as this awful woman. i need a beacon that says, \"not all old people.\"   conversely, my young relative less than half my age refuses to update his phone because \"it always breaks it.\" its os is so crapped it barely runs. i suggest restarting it and he goes into hysterics. yet i never see his brethren called out. /rant. i promise you, spoiled brats that can't find the \"on\" switch are of all-ages.  op, as a onetime retail veteran, i have nothing but sympathy for you in this convo.  some practical notes:  sales is a good career where women have the advantage. customers aren't afraid to ask women questions. learning people-handling deescalation techniques is a key life skill and you can pick your arena and decide how much money you want to make.   did you notice **this woman is afraid of you?** you have the upper hand; you just haven't played it as such. if you can physically contain your transaction to just you two, then find areas you agree, you can complete the sale and prevent her wrongheadness from getting put on blast somewhere.  walk her down the counter away from your coworker. point the husband at a display across the store and tell him you need a \"girls' conference.\" she's can't stay adversarial if you're her ally. turning this around can end with her becoming your promoter.@ my best helps that got me over a smoking habit that started when i was 6 and my smoking mother let me drag off her cigarettes-  round up all the paraphenalia you have for smoking. every ashtray, cigarette case, cut little blown-glass cigarette snuffer-thingy~ every single thing. smoke your last cigarette with big fanfare. i guess these days, post it online. whoop-whoop go all out. now toss all those things connected with it. reallocate the spot in the fridge the carton lived in if you do that. tell everyone you quit. wash your clothes or have your coats dry-cleaned. make note of everything that got a hole burned into it. that's in the past now!  here's my day-to-day tip that i'm positive saved me. people talk about gaining weight after quitting. it's the hand-to-mouth reflexive habit you've built and **you need something to replace it**. i used a tube of chapstick. i liked the cherry ones but you do you. and i had these everywhere. pants pockets, in my jacket~ when the restlessness comes on, apply chapstick. i broke it down into as many steps as i could; taking it from my pocket, twisting the cap off, twirling the wax up to the surface. apply. do all steps in reverse.  i \"loved\" smoking, never thought i'd quit, and this worked for me. some tubes went through the clothes dryer, but i haven't smoked since.@ just read an update about vaping. surprise, it's even worse. those chemicals seep even  deeper into lung tissue.@ congratulations on quitting! hydration and sleep hygiene will take one far.   i quit nearly 40 years ago and i can still get a restlessness i used to think smoking fixed. nope. only cements it as being a cure. gotta just ride out the feels.   when i quit, i got real curious at why smoking seemed like the perfect addition to 1) sitting with feelings of sadness, and  2) whooping it up with bands, bars and friends. why?  turns out it's a dosage thing. drawn deep into lungs- calming, short, quick puffs- enervating. the more i read, the angrier i got at how engineered it is, and the more i didn't want to be played. 10-12 minutes per cigarette? 'bout the same time as a blue-collar's work break. little, round tip? subconscious reads it as a nipple, equating smoking with drawing nutrients in. fun's fun, but is a tobacco nipple what you want to end your life over?   people feel such shame at not being able to quit. the truth is, others lie awake at night, dreaming of new ways to keep victims from escaping. read up on the latest info on  and  smoke.@ saw a perfect circle there. hp can't hold a candle to that.@ bimonthly support groups? even more potential lifeline-info!  man, big thanks for all this.@ well done on your persistence. where's the logic in a non-official report but i'm asking the wrong person now. wonder whose district that is? i'd definitely rope them in. with the woman still hanging around, why the non-911 response? so many questions. i'm really glad you're able to fight this. fwiw, i've done the same, going to the precinct offices demanding to file a report, then talking with its lead. protip for others- always get the incident number written on the cop's business-id card you've asked for.@ that's some media pablum. -how's about people getting murdered, metro? got any stronger language for that scenario? anything not in a passive voice?@ a quote from him you're referencing?@ i pass a homeless encampment where some tents are two stories tall. outfitted with furniture abandoned by persons evicted from their apartments.   the certainty of a fire in one of these~@  was made in 1976. with its meaty female lead and so many other strong parts, kinda surprised no-one's suggested a modern remake.  but then i also wonder why  isn't talked about these days. 1997 seems like present-day, and this movie's message has also improved over time.    edited = typo@ is this a stock photo? if they'd like help, maybe include the photo they're using? edit: link via u/foresightfarsight  i'm so sorry to read of the metro person dying from the attack.@ >the two cops tried to convince me not to file a report (i guess to keep crime stats down)  true and demonstrated coercion in one sentence!  i'm very sorry this happened to you.   it's likely on the cameras. i've learned complaints and going through channels are useless. consider lawyering up.@ it's nice it has fans and it looks like a wonderful addition. but they took out the universal amphitheater, which was a terrific venue.@ >  it's likely that your doc won't know what steps to take to get the ball rolling  exactly this@ firstly, thank you. the only resource i'd heard of is autism speaks, followed by nope. yours is new to me. i read their first paragraph and felt relief someone has set up what an adult needs. this may be the best resource i've ever gotten.   thank you so much for this!@ my family is so toxic, they are actual criminals. i've learned how to create a family with my friends. it's taken a turn as we age and people's un-faced problems become crippling. the social drinker who can't stop or faces health consequences from decades of smoking, etc. self-medication. i ducked out into therapy but so far i'm the only one. having a therapist act as ally and non-judgmental witness has been life-changing. i've created art that ventilates my old traumas. it's worked better than drowning in drink ever did. now i want to go farther and get this autism diagnosis. so grateful to all who wrote to me!@ congratulations on such a linear, sensible path! i learned from this to let the different experts stay in their lane and apply their expertise. eta: nobody has to be some cowboy riding in to rescue me.   i've had terrible experiences with pdocs carelessly prescribing whatever ssri-snri drugs was most heavily advertised or that they had samples of. these results were more traumatic than my autism, meaning i'd need months to recover and re-balance. no docs were apprised of my familial, now-suspected autism. i'd been drilled into autism being our families' shameful, guilty secret.   your story cheered me up. if you're comfortable with it, could you tell me what type of drug has helped you?@ i'm so glad for you getting help, and it sounds like the right help.  the us pdocs are so tied to \"in my office = prescription written,\" that i fear them. the american insurance industry believes that's the only outcome for a patient visiting them. if a pdoc doesn't write a scrip, it creates complications for them to get paid. or, that's how it's been presented to me.@ i thnk you're right. my age and gender gets dismissed pretty frequently. i have a good doc, i think, but my insurance is said to have limitations. need to push back.  i took your advice as a reminder to advocate for myself with vigor. thank you@ i'm so glad to read you are safe and well. i admire your self-care. walking in the alps! what great medicine!@ my bugaboo too. it caused me to be a friend who'd interrupt a friend to (smugly) tell them how to fix their problem(s). saw the light with help from my therapist so recently my username reflects my old persona.   sometimes being a friend means being a witness and letting them vent.   hello, world.@ i read a version of this decades ago, in a miss manners book. suspect it's been part of the etiquette advice-dispensing game forever. glad to see it here.@ i was reading it out loud, in case it was a spell in disguise.@ no \"\"@ he didn't get a prize, because he was off being led astray@   >aslan has been gone for so long an ass passes himself for him and starts a civil war.   strangely relevant today@ well, he's not a tame lion~@ once you have your favorite, you can't ever switch. unless \"belgium chocolate\" is in the prospect's name. then, carry on.@ after getting to go with her parents to america. then her siblings explained her away as \"she's spent her whole life wanting to be the age she is and now wants to stay there\" or some such. she's met aslan but now she's obsessed with clothes.@ a woman was the daughter of a star, and later married caspian.@ it's a wartime cautionary tale. the pevensies get moved to the countryside home of the professor, to keep them safe from the blitz. ~~we learn the professor is the same person~~ who was present at narnia's creation. thinking of london cabby, frank. \"the magician's nephew\" became the professor.  \"the last battle\" tells of people rushing to \"follow\" a donkey who's been trussed in a lion's carcass and paraded before them as aslan, their true leader. the apocalypse and the true land awaiting them afterward, isn't unique to christianity.  mankind loves metaphor!  what hasn't aged well for me is the presentation of  \"dark-faced\" peoples as worshippers of another, \"bad\" god.  there's a small inside joke in that calling someone a \"donkey\" is an insult. to call someone out as being \"a donkey inside a donkey,\" is pretty much the sound of gloves coming off to many people.@ she was fighting with her sister, who was charn's true ruler. the white witch had gone through monstrous trials to learn the deplorable word. in a battle with her sister, they were face-to-face and the sister says \"victory\", ww says \"yes, but not yours\" and utters the deplorable word that ended her sister's reign, her life, charn, and their entire world.  somehow ww was allowed to gain a throne in the room of what i'd assumed where her ancestors, previous rulers who'd turned into evil people in subsequent generations.  source: went back and did a closer read of \"chronicles\" after realizing they were a cautionary tale written within wwii.  eta: wondering if the person sitting next to her in the throne room was the sister?@ , and you're exactly right on your first points.@ there's bad old data that taught professionals women weren't autistic in the same numbers as cis males. newer data is created using knowledge that women have learned how to mask.  do please consider getting an evaluation. it will help you, and others seeking evaluation.@ i am so sorry these events happened to you. they shouldn't have.@ the kids holding up hearts behind the family~ bet there wasn't a dry eye in the room. all the love, family.@ thank you for this! im in the us too, major city w/teaching hospitals. yet the only place i found which does adult autism evaluations is at ucla, which charges five thousand dollars cash for the evaluation. no insurance. i've been intrigued at a state-funded college adopting a private-clinic stance but- one battle at a time. i'm excited for you!@ i'm so sorry this has been done to you. my hope is we are gaining visibilty. that hannah gasby got not one but two netflix specials where she talks about \"hidden\" autism in adult women, gave me hope.@ disagree with your premise. some can't get an evaluation. i'd love to have this for work, school, self-employment options. to have a state-paid rehabilitation specialist shrug and say, \"lots of people come in here saying they're autistic\" as if we were keeping her from going to lunch on time~ i can't describe how hurtful this is.@ senator lisa murkowski- daughter of senator ted murkowski- has a lamentable record. her work with the canadian company pushing to put a mine in a vital river feeding the salmon industry can only be construed as aiding and abetting.  is one of many groups pushing back.   this is a  to de-fund their colleges. a state who contracts ferry services to native villages to starve them out, and.@ first, congratulations! you didn't mention your dr being part of the stopping-drinking; where is that expert in your mix? \"dr drew\" (pinksy) has said alcohol is the one drug which can't be quit cold-turkey. i know people who've done it but it gets a complex wrap on the brain.   consider getting a blood work-up. a longtime addiction can wring out the adrenals and thyroid. that's going to make anyone feel bleh. this information will be useful to your pdoc. take care to put basics in- enough sleep, enough water. your job sounds stressful so try to eat well at the intervals that work for you. a few months of this and some exercise should help you recover your sense of fun, though how you deliver those zingers may shift. once it's safe again for 12-step meetings you may find some understanding and some laughs there. drink works great to smooth out aspie bumps- until it doesn't. you're on the right side of this. one step at a time. i'm excited for you.@ that's also a fun train ride starting from union station in la.@ \\- might need your zip code if this link doesn't work@ the vintage trains on display are also interesting!  eta: ventura has some terrific artists who sell their work. must be a street fair or two as well.@ i've always wanted to go to julien in the fall. i saw a story on it in aaa magazine. it's an apple-growing area to the east, off the beaten track between la and san diego.@ i like the way you phrased it. i feel i know exactly what you meant.@ thank you, trai. glad you push back, too!  of my two questions, i feel more strongly about this one. aaa has a large membership of persons who contract with it because they want safety. having my dmv info become permanent property of a towing company has the opposite effect. california's opt-out is for websites but may have applications here i will be following up with the dmv on this.@ thank you for your reply! sounds like these cards are something we need to get loud about with our representatives.  i doubt all that data is encrypted.@ in los angeles, i'd boarded the subway. a sheriff's deputy scanned my metro tap (transit access pass) card to see if i'd paid my fare. i saw the sheriff's large handheld device displayed more information than i'd expected. i asked him if he could see my entire history and he let me see, as he scrolled with his thumb, my history was indeed displayed.   i'd later asked a uniformed metro employee ***why*** this was possible. the employee said, \"you wouldn't believe the histories of people we get on here. we *have to have that information* when we interact with the public.\"   this was a rank-and-file metro worker, so i said, i could see they needed to verify whether i'd paid my fare. but if they needed more information, that should be aided by conferring with a supervisor, who would need a warrant.   i didn't convince this worker and hadn't planned to. the covid restrictions went into effect before i could follow up.  -your thoughts, please?@ hi micah  in california, the auto club \"aaa\" tells its members requesting roadside assistance that their driver's licenses will be **scanned** by the **tow truck driver**. there's no information on why the tow truck driver- company is allowed to access information i thought was confined to the department of motor vehicles (dmv) or law enforcement.   i've refused to let this happen to my license, holding it in my hand so they can look at its number and my photo.   i feel certain the dmv has not encrypted the information, and equally sure this is an illegal search and seizure. your thoughts, and action recommendations?   thanks in advance@ i've found my writing resolves as i go along. i compared an early draft to a later one and remembered i'd had a block at one point. i'd resolved it with the later writing.  put a note to yourself at the point you're concerned about, and keep going forward. could be that the character's later actions make the story and dialogue clearer.@ look at not comparing anything that's still in your head to what you have written down.   writing is re-writing, and stories can evolve in unexpected ways, as you've already learned.   just write, or, as was said to me-  \"ass + chair.\"@ start it at the point the characters start talking to you. write from there. with the ability to make new chapters with ease, if you find the story starts earlier, make a new chapter that will contain that storyline and insert it.   eavesdrop on your characters and get used to how they tell you the story. try taking dictation from them as you form the first draft. don't censor them or try to force the story where you thought it \"should\" go. be present, and type what they talk.@ well-stated! i don't understand how people can talk on and on about hair or shopping. i'm sure my twitching comes across as disdain or rejection. at the same time, i've longed to have a friendship that (pre-covid) was going to the mall, followed by lunch. they look like they're having such a companionable time! not all conversations have to be about electrical sags and old fuseboxes. if i drift there, i drift alone. :)@ >sometimes, the person talking has been so clear that i have already understood their point.  this describes my processing exactly! i \"get it\" re their point, and i have things to say. or we're in more of a debate and i want to argue a point they're raised right now in that moment, before it gets buried by something new.   i don't want to be rude. but i'm sure that's how i'm read.@ yeah, but, i'm guilty of it too. i get excited at the other person's conversation and want to contribute right then. i'm apologizing to people when i do it, and really working at training myself to refrain.  i'm *positive* my pattern of interrupting has lost me a friends and angered bosses. i can let people finish describing their thought.   wish it hadn't gone on so long~ i've asked my therapist to call it out, and to be \"allowed\" time to participate! i can monologue on my private time.@ i'm going to try your leaning back tip. a mechanical correction seems very promising! thank you for writing!@ i'm sorry to read this happens to you and so many others. i try to tilt a glass correctly. either nothing comes out or its down my chin and front. humiliating!@ >i've taken a lunch on my 6th hour and **was told to not clock out for it** when i did get the chance to take it. i was then told by my am that it would be \"fixed\" that happened yesterday as i wrote this and was the last straw  congratulations! you've won a  award!   your employer cannot do what you've described. california has some of the strictest laws in the us protecting employees. contact a labor attorney.@ mac is the bomb. how he emerged from brittney-spears-level grifter dad-parent and all his early fame is beyond me. nice to see him having a laugh at a time he's clearly at peace with.  you should see him in one of my favorite dark, teen-type movies. wonderful character he created for that.@ i like that they give an estimate of the shipping costs, so i can know what i'm spending.@ i've achieved cat happiness by using a men's wood-handled, boar-bristle brush i got at a drugstore. cheaper than the pet store brushes.  it's a wide, flat paddle-shape, but the best part is each side has a set of bristles, one softer than the other. i labeled one side \"soft\" to easily use that side on kitteh's face. i alternate the sides as i brush her body. it gives her fur a nice sheen. she adores this brush and lets me know she'd like a brushing by tapping it with her paw.@ and then run the a/c so the seals don't dry out and leak all the coolant.@ that's marvelous! hope there's photos too. what a great project.@ i knew a now-american who contracted polio as a young person in their home country. i'd watch them go by, swinging their nearly-useless legs between two aluminum crutches, going to the bus every day to go to work.   in their spare time, they helped raise a fine young person and were active in their church. i had lots of time to contemplate my own character. but fuck anti-vaxxers and their privilege.@ please consider getting this precious history written down! the real stories  such as yours are so necessary.@  has a deep book selection with lots of lovely vintage books as well as more recent everyday types.   **and, your purchase is giving someone a good job!** i've bought wonderful things of all types from this auction site, never a problem. matching the photographs, all wear is pointed out, and very well-packed.@ emily powell had an eloquent post on the powell's site, which i haven't been able to re-locate. they buy access through amazon and that doesn't leave much for them. another powell's blog post has more info - and suggestions - on using your purchasing might to support indie books.  author jenny lawson of \"bloggess\" fame opened her own bookstore, but in addition to shipping from her store, she also uses  . et remove links-@ i'm so sorry your niece had to endure that. and i don't want to minimize your thoughts and experience. it's clearly a rite that is different lots of places despite sharing the same name.  leaving dolls and putting on high heels - i'm learning a lot from your reply. my family traditions leaned more towards \"are you still here?\" :) thank you for teaching me.@ i first saw him in  wonderful indie film. mark's characters are so real, and he and a very small rory culkin are so many people you know. mark's earned his success. can't imagine working while having a  slurring words.@ that pet rock craze! my friend had one and it had its own house!@ never too late for cake. and best wishes for your marriage!@ all these lovely ceremonies get blown to hell by the one-upsmanship. i used to enjoy people-watching out front of the la county art museum (lacma). people love to have photographs casual and professional taken here, under the vintage streetlight installation. there's everything from shy first-date selfies to full-blown weddings and quinceaeras.   my culture doesn't have rite-of-passage ceremonies, so the girls in their gowns fascinate me. i took a reverse-angle shot of a girl whose daddy is standing next to the photographer; a huge, proud smile on his face at seeing his little girl grown up.   all the feels. - quinceaeras for everybody! just don't go broke doing it.@ >\"or how those people look?\"  yes, she erased them as humans and as beings deserving recognition and respect. it doesn't get much worse than that. your feelings are exactly right.   if you'd like to be evaluated, ask through your school staff or your doctor, if you're friendly with that person.@ supposedly-  back in the '70's, an american woman sold empty cans labeled \"florida sunshine\" and made a million dollars.@ >even knowing that my spouse does not give 2cents to care about what i write.  i think i found the problem.   for the pigs on mars people, if you're feeling charitable you could turn this. get excited at their discovery; draw them out. \"wow, i don't know how to write that type of story, how cool! what would happen to the characters? is it set in the past, future, or where-?\"   i read a great counter for the old, \"writing's easy\" assertion. \"writing can be really hard for me at times! mind showing me some of yours?\"@ did you disclose your status at time of hire? it's a tricky thing, as many just want to work without disclosing. i know i did. but it will get you additional protections (as i understand the laws.)   if you had an agency help you get hired, they should be contacted now.   i'm so sorry you were hurt and lost your job, but you'll need to advocate for yourself as you're having those feelings. tell your care team (doctors, family, friends) what's happened.@ your comment is well-said.   historically, there was the \"no irish need apply\" signage on many american factories - and then john fitzgerald kennedy became president.   watch the original \"west side story\" to see and hear some choice racial hazing.@ even if a person isn't planning to get pregnant, there's a lot more to this surgery than, say, having one's tonsils or appendix removed.   i knew someone who had to have a hysterectomy. her ovaries were also removed; not sure if that is done today.  the uterus also contracts during orgasm for many women, so that was an additional blow. she didn't get any hormonal replacement medication, or any counseling, to deal with feeling she'd been de-sexed.  it was barbaric.   she became self-destructive, her pos husband dumped her, then she suicided.@ oh, you're right; i hadn't thought it through no room for a drive~  thank you@ miss blake, you are adorable but your hair is a truly glorious color! you deserve a better haircut that shows off its shine and your smile! how would you feel about letting your hair get a bit more length?@ have you seen the redditor trick- buy a box of floor tiles rather than a junky plastic mat? i don't have a link but the pics looked stylish.@ i used to build racked edit systems for clients. i'd ask them what the editor was going to sit at and some said \"oh we'll get a banquet table set up and buy a chair from (x)\" i sometimes didn't get far advocating for the editor's safety in a 10-hour shift, but i could and did close sales saying, \"you're leaving your company open to a osha lawsuit over rsi (repetitive stress injury.\")  story2: my partner had a good friend who was seated when she leaned against the seat of her chair to talk to a person behind her. chair broke without warning and she broke her back.  \\-sent from my steelcase@ i'd been wondering if the police intervene when they see people being hit and kidnapped?@ be kind, please rewind! engines ready.@ i was thinking the hard drive and the metal case, as it appears to be the battery. i used to see people pretty upset when their ipods died, but there wasn't the repair options as we have now. lots of those people would've repaired their buddies if they could have. just my 2 cents@ it can be repaired!

baaaaack up.@ i had a client who'd routinely pick the inexpensive template, then as the deadline approached would ask for add-ins, stopping work to go get the new resources until the job was back at the high end. i was hired to be the bad cop and get a hold of the client. i started instituting change orders that said the deadline was now tba, the client needed to sign off on the change, and here was the cost of adding feature in.  it would have been fine except client called boss whining and boss commiserated with them what a hardass i was. moral: don't work for a ~~daddy's girl~~  boss high on misused meds. eta: applies to anyone.@ hope to see more of your work. it's lovely@ i talked about the \"freeze\" thing with a professional a couple days ago. it's not a character defect, it's an evolved response. it's why first responders and others have to train to override it. i had a freeze when v young and confronted with another needing help. i do mental drills (what street is this, how close to landmark, what direction travelling, color of person's outfit) to stay sharp. but, physically responding still took me a second. i said call 911 before remembering i had my phone.@ had a dentist who got hooked on his liquid cocaine. nice young guy. he put some in my eye when i scratched it with my contacts.   bet it didn't end well.@ trumpy- '46. mcd '55.@ i talked about a specific friend i was alienating, that seemed better than a generality. he said she wanted to be my friend. i told him i feel like i have to perform, sometimes. and i've had jobs where it was useful. that teaches me bad habits, i said. and even therapy i barely let him get a word in. it's a work in progress, you know?@ i am talking to my therapist about my habit of doing this. it wrecks friendships. everyone wants to feel what they are saying is interesting and will be listened to. my mind gets the point they are leading up to, digests it and is ready to move on. while they're still speaking. the pressure builds up in side of me, is it like that for your too? the thing is, i love people's stories!@ congratulations! terrific success!@ i don't know the answer to your question but i can tell you we bought a v clean motorcycle from a guy and saw the license plates were out of date. nbd right? oh the dmv wanted us to pay for every year unlicensed and the fines. several times more what the bike cost. guess it got parted out after that and it was a nice bike. so good luck with the dmv@ hurrah!

 better- ask to see/meet with his cpa/hire your own cpa to audit the books and the tax returns on the existing store. is there a ground lease or does he own the buildings outright? is he incorporated? pull the dunn and bradstreet. ask his insurance company for proof of insurance and a report. has their been a claim?  it helps that you have so much day to day experience but even so, plan for a scenario where you don't know everything. is he facing a divorce, a lien or an audit and hiding assets? does he owe any private loan to someone trying to collect? who inherits the business if the boss dies? you'd need to be covered by the insurance should a customer attempt to sue you personally for an animal death or injury.  \\-i knew a blue-collar person who was asked to be the managing partner for two wealthy couples who'd bought a bar. their contribution was day to day management \"sweat equity\" that'd be paid as a full share when the bar was sold. after a major renovation, the bar was in an area exploded by gentrification and became massively popular. the two monied couples worked hard to screw the managing partner out of their well-earned share. eta- clarifications@ i'm not a parrothead but your frisky names are hilarious. i was going to ask you if the crew told you these were their names.@ i rented a uhaul for a local move. thankfully the starter waited until the move was done and i was gassing it up empty, to blow up. the station's manager was immediately mad it was blocking a pump. i'd gotten the extra insurance on it and their call center told me i'd have to wait with it till they could pick it up. i said my security services would be $200 an hour with a four-hour minimum and they had no reply. the manager and i pushed it to the side of his station, i took my bike out of the back, locked the keys inside and left it. never heard anything more about it. this was 20 years ago and i doubt it'd work today- but it's still fun to feel i won a round for once.   i'd recommend getting their insurance (read the contract) because of this experience. it's usually a gimmie for the person writing the contract but on a stressful move? yup.@ user groups for any software you're using are overall not bad. i had a bad experience with being bullied on stack exchange that's made me unwilling to use it now.@ you could pretend to throw them away and see how long it is until you need one. but coyote the trickster will likely not fall for that.   tl;dr- try tossing one and you'll need it.@ i've seen a gnarly storm near woodland hills where the lightening hit so close it made me shout with fear. there's a pocket on ventura near warner center that not only gets hotter than hell, fires to the west rained ash on my car like snow.@ if only more systems had decent surge protectors. or full fledged power conditioners with battery backups. it's my favorite thing to educate people on, especially ones who are building more robust wfh setups.@ ohh, glad you wrote with this link. that's a spectacular design! clean, deceptively simple and deeply symbolic. i think i'm becoming a flag-design-fan, too.*  the designer(s) nailed it.  *i haven't earned the title yet. :). eta wonder if roman knows how far his influence reaches if he was indeed the impetus for the upgrade.@ \"little demon\" is my fave label too. glad she's retired after her win.@ i've read all your (very patient and good-humored) replies. i know some bigger things, like the basics are around the perimeter of the store and the middle-height of the shelves is highest sought- but- what store strategy did you learn during this exercise that most surprised you?

should one ask to see a sample book to catch things like too-thin paper?   i follow  as she's published several books with an agent and there's still stories of one print run getting bound with parts of another author's book, though that was an international version i think. so what should one do?   the llc is one requirement i knew of, as is, registering copyright and maybe indicate the title is going to be used in business, to get a working trademark. i've bookmarked getting the isbn's from bowker and registered the .com. finding the print-on-demand is my last part.  have you any suggestions?  i agree with you that the battle is still yours to win.   thanks for sharing your story@ everyone's a phone call away from having it the dream come true. be well, i'll be thinking of you.@ my test just came back negative, while i had a cinder block on my chest from feb-march so i doubt my test found antibodies. i probably didn't cough hard enough or something when i did the swab-swish of my throat.   also this demon has a long tail. i still have chest pain and a couple times, trouble waking up. never mind it's not safe to walk outside with entire families out without masks.   sad i never saw europe!@ i see you're offering cake with that.   happy cake day!@ what a feat - your prep and artistry, and his record! congratulations to you both.@ last time that happened to me i'd left a pineapple in a grocery bag. it was a bit behind a chair and i was in the cloud o gnats by the time i found it.   they clear out fast without a food supply.@ what's not awesome is flu and covid resurgence will co-exist with fire season. i've seen information saying this summer will be the hottest on record. despite fines for not removing hanging dead branches, they're everywhere near studio city and laurel canyon.   i don't want us to turn into oakland after the fires, but i've been beating the drum since last winter. i suspect my congressman and assemblyman have blocked me.@ i've seen people wearing cloth masks they have to keep readjusting as the strings have stretched or the cloth sags.   it's ok to use the pleated paper ones with the metal nose band that stays in place! honest!   ditch the masks that don't protect you!@ your renter's insurance offer any help? file a formal complaint with k+b and copy to your insurer.   or try 211 for renter's advocate agencies. it would seem to be a violation of any lease offering the peaceful enjoyment of your home, but we're on new ground with this.@ they are ancient war machines, designed to illuminate the battlefield. no wonder they're horrid.@ >  it's like, why am i struggling so hard here when i can thrive literally anywhere else?  that's where we differ, sounds like. what drew you to invest in a move to la?  i got handed a lot of \"work for freeeee\" in two popular northern cities and i just couldn't, because making money in la can come from so many sources. the real secret here is this isn't an employee place. it's an invent your own job place.  find a need and fill it. put something together and pitch it- a script, a business idea. also, i'm not courting girls- i get that, that aspect is huge. worked for a guy who was a big deal with the ladies in his home town. couldn't crack this market and went home.   people here had the talk with their families back home and said, \"dad, i love you but i don't want to work at your hardware store\"- and the heat was on. - eta that's what i like about la. that can-do. i like not knowing i'm going to have a casual chat with stevie wonder that day. i like art gallery openings and standing in front of a van gogh.   you've got genuine concerns and no one has the 2020 playbook or apocalypse bingo card as some wits call it- and we are not even into fire season yet, while weather is forecast to be hottest on record this year and the city isn't ready~ the lease is a legal problem. if rents do drop here maybe you can renegotiate your lease.   it may be you'll move back to your supportive world and write a witty blog-that-becomes-a-book on your time here. lots of people you know dreamed of doing as you did, and didn't made it happen. you've already beaten some odds. what does that mean? only you know.  i'm glad you wrote back thanks.@ i wrote op a long-ish reply maybe parts are helpful to you.   i've left la a couple times and keep coming back. best place of all to cobble together a new or 2.0 life. being surrounded by people doing the same can't be measured! no legacies or \"this is how we do things here\"@ second this- line one on studio jobsearches is four-year degree unless it's an internship. op has a big advantage and would work with better people. @ i believe you.   is it fair to say there was a mismatch in expectations? sometimes people have their finger on the fire button and maybe for reasons out of your control. something i learned after a few firings of my own was to set 30, 60, 90 day expectations for performance with my new manager.- who's my trainer i can ask questions of?

do you see a group on social media? networking~  go through the  process and see if school can be an option. with online classes losing their stigma, financial aid and a certificate course could transform you and your timing is very good for getting started.   **eta- deadline's june 30th!!** what's great about this option, is a current skills assessment testing will show you where your strengths and interests lie.  is it too late?

im a 23 yr old trans nb (ftx) from nh. full disclosure i have a partner but we're both radical leftist poly nb witches (and, fuller disclosure, both white). ive been really hoping to make connections with fellow spiritual trans folks- message me if you want to chat and maybe make friends (or maybe more if that sounds okay 2 ewe)@ i sympathize really hard with you- i worked in two nh public schools and it turned me off of education entirely. as you're well aware the pay in nh is exceptionally low, and the schools in nh vary greatly in resources, curriculum and morale. i have friends that have had better luck with employment in vt or ma in regards to pay and educational integrity.  i second the previous comment- if you have a unique pov you could do very well to think about opening a business (there are golden nuggets of towns in nh where the right store or place of business could do very well, given the right environment). this might be difficult in the immediate future- maybe remote work or keeping an eye on local libraries in the interim. meditate on your interests and your unique povs and skills. best of luck@ you have tons of options- nh is thick with townships. lets break it down  seacoast is your best bet for proximity to cities but is by far the most expensive. the cities here are very nice- portsmouth, dover and somersworth all have their own things going on a lot. i don't personally know of any rural towns here but i hear a lot about osipee.  there are a few cities in se nh that have tons of resources but little to no \"scene\". if that doesn't matter to you, exeter and nashua are both titans of industry. if you place yourself strategically, youre close to these cities, the coast, and boston is less than an hour away.  manchester is the largest city in the state but its a craphole. the capitol, concord, is far nicer- theres a lot of towns around there to check out. franklin is known for its forests; bow, suncook, and bedford are very nice little towns with ample space. bedford especially is lovely but very expensive.  those are all of the larger cities in the state. if you like a college town, keene is really nice and there are tons of tiny towns in proximity with ample forests. hanover is the same but in the middle of the state- maybe a bit ritzier than keene but its right next to the border to vt which is great. neither one are culturally super rich but have nice things to do.  another option is to look north across the border from burlington, if thats your scene. there are tons of tiny towns up there, littleton is very cute.  i have nothing else to say but to avoid sullivan county haha claremont is terribly expensive for a tiny backwards town and newport is a black hole of depravity@ i am not currently dealing with ue but in my experience, pay hold means theyre checking references, former employers and such. best of luck to you both@ hmmm if you're in the area newport nh had one when i was a kid@ you have excellent taste op! don't listen to the plague cucks in the comments, your commitment to personal freedom will surely protect you from catching or carrying any contagious diseases.  but new hampshire is very very dangerous to out of staters. the water here will turn you gay. even the water in the air will instantly convert you into a raging homosexual with no known cure or recourse. no one else will tell you the truth op but i will not let anything happen to my favourite plague rat@ as someone else with a delicate constitution, the show isn't too bad; you can usually see coming exactly what will happen. for example, the finale runways are glamour, filth and horror. the horror runways are usually tame and more creative than gorey, buuuut the filth ones can get nasty.  ive obsessively watched dragula a few times over- if you want to comment or dm me with anything specifically upsetting i would be happy to do a quick write up :)@ the article says this was this kids third flight in the last couple weeks. i wouldnt say it was exactly an accident waiting to happen, but~ stay home, stay safe@ theres some great places in connecticut! its a lovely state with a lot to offer  :) (we dont need more tourists theres a pandemic lol)@ if anyone here thinks this is \"probably fake\", come meet an actual trans person living in new hampshire. i have been harassed, in public, in small towns, in downtown manchester, in a fucking dunkin donuts a man openly mocked and harassed my partner and i with absolutely no recourse. just existing in public while looking genderfucky is dangerous. putting politics aside, this person is very brave for existing in the public sphere as a nonbinary trans person.   i am not saying there is no chance this is somehow fabricated. but this can, and does, absolutely happen, every day.  if you're not trans you are wasting everyones time talking about something you know nothing about. educate urself or shut ur mouth. i wont deign responses to cistakes (read: try it and you're blocked- die mad about it)@ what does this meaaaaaan lmao ~. gender fluids?@ at least im not entitled enough to ask for an edit of a 500+ episode podcast with a third of the creators edited out (why, out of curiosity?)  or cowardly enough to delete the thread once two (2) people mildly called out how fucked up that is  or petty enough to come back after deleting said thread to try to dunk, while also~ being a hypocrite? if ur gonna call someone out for name calling, maybe dont call them an even crueler term~.. just a thought@ monster factory or uh~~ listen to another show. snowflake@ porn bots gettin mighty sneaky@ what song is it thooooo@ some witches are men~. or bisexual~ or~. bisexual men @ matt farley is a damn treasure!!

public health facts and mentioning an ongoing pandemic is not the tea huntee @ if there was no demand these shows wouldn't be put on. same general reason as why stores are open on christmas- its not the workers, its the management trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of them and the selfish customer base. in a perfect world the goal would be to preserve lives- im not saying i have the answers but defending decisions that are objectively against the interest of public safety isnt it!@ no one should be going to restaurants either. i can concede that a car event has less risk of transmission (still not 0) than the multiple live in person events that are also very much happening- which is just not an appropriate thing to do in the current climate imo.  people choosing to host and go to crowded shows when there is any chance of transmission are admitting its okay to them for people to get sick nd die as long as they get what they want@ im not talking abt performers im talking abt blood thirsty producers and rabid fans who dont care enough about community safety to go without live shows until an epidemic is contained, god forbid@ holy shit thank god someone said something, i cannot believe people are hosting or attending shows rn!!

      "i did, for too long. i found out long after she did, and he had by then abandoned their relationship. in todays terms one would say he ghosted her after he met me. but of course, that was stupid of me. he had shown his true colors. i left the relationship (maturely, by telling him) a few weeks later.@ i was the other woman, didnt know it, and felt awful.@ you really should get some professional mediation. that could be via clergy, an attorney, social services, etc. you are angry, and i get that, i really do. you were lied to by people who are supposed to be loving, supportive relatives  the people we want to believe will always be there for us, our whole lives. and the lie was not something insignificant, it doesnt fall into the category of it doesnt concern you.  it was about the care and safety of your son. it was about his emotional and mental health.  and possibly his physical safety.   but heres the other thing:  i know nothing about the father, other than that he didnt want the child and wanted terminate the pregnancy. i know he was good enough for you to be in a relationship with at one point. thats it. thats all i know.   there are other important things to know. has he changed?  is he a better person?  does he love his son now that he knows him?  does he know the money is t going to you?  does he know you were lied to, kept out of the loop? does he want to accept responsibility?  is he well-intentioned but stupid?  why did he involve the step brother instead of asking an attorney to contact you (or your mom, or write you a letter, or ask a mutual friend, or ask social services or a member of the clergy)?  did he make a mistake in trusting the step brother?  is he a danger to your son?  is there a risk he would try to accomplish now what he couldnt at the abortion clinic?    you really need to know more before you do anything irrevocable. but you do know one thing:  the current babysitting situation is untenable. there are a lot of bad actors in this story. you need to protect your son first and foremost, then protect yourself.   i am guessing you are not well-off, yet you chose to accept the responsibility for the pregnancy and to do your best for the child.  this is laudable, and you have my utmost respect. you have been blindsided, and of course you are confused. this is an awful situation. period.   my advice to you is this:  (1). remove your son from all of these people while you figure out whats going on. (2) contact your local welfare/social services office. someone there can help you. (3) give yourself time and space to think. no matter what text or call you get, there is only one thing you need to say right now. i need time to think. i dont want to talk about this with you right now.  you may have to say it a lot. over and over and over. do not engage in arguments or discussions or even conversations with any of these people right now. this is a raw wound; they are toxic. keep them out of the wound.   please get someone unrelated involved. several people have suggested an attorney. they are not neutral, but it may still be a good idea. if you are a church-goer, get your minister involved. ministerial counseling can be very fruitful. and it may be that some people in trout church can offer help with things like babysitting while you are figuring out what to do next.   dont rush. it feels like an emergency, but thats the adrenaline. think of it like a house on fire. get out of the building; get safe. then worry about whats next. the emergency is over. theres a lot left to do, but get safe first.@ you are a very lucky woman, because you are not without options. many women have no options. dont waste yours.@ to be fair, 4 people died; 75% of the deaths were non-vegans, and at least one other vegan on the trek did not die.  gives more information. weird that people want this to be true and take a perverse pleasure in her death.@ *and* cut the abortion number. statistics show that this will also cut future crime rates.@ interesting choice of word: impact.  i would have said contact.  what say others?@ who has a camera trained on the remote camera?@ good decision. too late. cats out of the bag, cant unring the bell, and all that. from the article: this isnt the first time soros has publicly attacked a technology company. in january 2018, he said google and facebook are a menace to society and obstacles to innovation.@ ive been working on getting harvey to trust me. hes feral. he no longer runs into the woods when i open the back door. i do hope to get him fixed, and hopefully he will eventually come inside. he hangs out with two other feral cats, both females, one of whom has been spayed (her ear is clipped).  thanks for writing that, because everyone should know.@ i know him!  thats harvey!  he comes to our house for brunch.@ prosecution. not the same thing. he only feels persecuted.@ i was a daily washer. when i decided to to cut back, i tried every other day for a while, and it was unsatisfactory. i persevered, and progressed to every third day, then 4th. it took a while but now i wash once a week and its far healthier. it has grown longer, too, maybe because i dont dry it out so much and make it brittle. i dunno, and dont care. i just really like this once a week schedule. it made travel *so* much easier  back when travel was still a thing.@ im sorry you miscarried. that is a difficult thing, even if the pregnancy wasnt planned or desired.  and the farther along one is, the more difficult. i hope you are well.   that said, your family relationship will likely never be what it once was. and that may be for the best.   how did your sister know you are engaged?  are you friends with her on facebook, or perhaps via mutual friends?    how broad was the blade that cut you off?  grandparents?  aunts and uncles, cousins?  have any of your relatives made an attempt to keep in touch?  did you, and were you rejected?  im just trying to figure out what happened that let them know about the engagement.   cutting you off was cruel, and they should be ashamed. are they offering an apology, or are they saying that the marriage makes you legitimate again, and worthy of their love?  and more importantly, how do you feel about all that?    what does your fianc think?  will he accept your decision, or pressure you one way or the other?  remember, too, that he will be trying to make you happy, and his responses might be what he thinks you want to hear.   someday, you will have children to raise with this man you love. do you want them to be influenced by those grandparents?  grandparents who will judge and disown, or by the set that will love, accept, and support?  of course its possible to have more than one set of grandparents. but not necessary. and perhaps not healthy.   i dont have any clear advice, but i honestly think you have to know more (maybe you do), and some of what you need to know is how you feel, once the turmoil is past.   may i suggest that you postpone any decision for a few weeks while your emotions settle?  please give yourself time to adjust to this new development before you react. seriously, just ignore the message(s) for a few days. or weeks. they threw you out for *years*, they can wait a month or two while you think.@ is it possible that she was hoping that by dissing the big-deal proposal, it might pave the way for you to go ahead ask?  like, trying to take the pressure off you to do a big thing so you would just go ahead and do it?@ german driver here. no. flashing high beams on freeway is illegal.@ no genitalia?@ nah. even quadrupeds have this dichotomy.@ feels well-regulated to me.@ ok, first, what would they do if you couldnt pay?  i mean, if you (and your husband) simply didnt have the money?  i dont know the answer to this; i am not asking a rhetorical question.   if your brother would go to prison, and possibly die there, what would they do?  because this is the worst thing i can think realistically could happen, and from the tone of your letter, i dont think thats even a possibility. so we move on.   secondly: your brother is 18. he wanted a car, but you resisted. your instincts were correct. ask yourself what is it about your family dynamics that made you know this was a likely outcome?  im guessing your brother is consistently irresponsible.   third: your younger brother wanted a car and he didnt simply ask you to help him pay for one. he whined and tried to manipulate you, implying that you spent *your* money poorly by buying your parents a gift (vacation) instead of getting him a car. this suggests he feels entitled, another angle to his irresponsibility. actually, he has no right to your income. if he cant work (mental or physical disability) then a good family member would try to help with his expenses. but he just wants things. and he could do what you did:  get a job and save up. thats what your other brother did, too, right?  so why does your younger brother think *your* money should be used to get *him* things?  or in this case, to get him out of trouble?    why did your older brother give him the car?  why isnt he the one expected to pay for the consequences of giving him the car?    heres the thing. your family expects to be able to tell you what to do; this is not appropriate. i know there are different traditions, but not all traditions are wise. it would be unwise to bail him out.  you are correct in wanting your brother to be held responsible, and to have to deal with the consequences of his actions. this will be difficult for him. but he made the decisions that caused this. not you.   bottom line:  do not pay.   you may want to consult an attorney, privately, and learn more about the laws and the consequences. what you hear from your family may not be accurate.   as for your husband, will he want to pay, to keep the peace?  this is complicated. he really should respect your wisdom; you knew something like this would happen long before it did. i hope your husband will not side with your family.@ if you read this post as a stranger, wouldnt your first thought be why is he paying rent to live in a musty, buggy basement with people who have literally no respect for him? hon, you need to move. not for them, but for you.  dont discuss it with them any longer. you havent changed, they have. and both are fine.  its not wrong, either way. but it does mean you guys are no longer compatible.   you do whatever you want in the house that you pay for, and as long as the things you want are reasonable (and your description sounds like it), they need to deal.   you are correct that if the dog barks at a person who lives there (you), and she wakes up, thats an issue with the dog.   meanwhile, put feelers out. look for another place to live.  being able to walk to work is such a plus, i can see how you are reluctant to go. we can walk to work, and its worth the higher rent here.   good luck.   ps. clean up your mess. that is better for you. really. if you struggle with it, there are lots of sites that can offer methods. my method, which is slowly working, is just pick one spot and get control over that. i started with my bedside table. four months later and one spot at a time, i now have a clear bedroom. good luck.@ your brother has no right to tell you how to sort this out. you get to decide for you. he gets to make his own decisions, but not yours. even if i were to agree with him, i wouldnt agree that he can require you to tailor your relationships with your parents to suit him.   im not sure i follow some of this.  your brother is still with the woman who not only cheated on him, she did so with his father?  and now theyre going to have children together?    perhaps your brother needs to clean up his own relationships before expecting you to follow his lead.@ can you say fraud?@ just seen:  the the what meme  on an actual ad (and i look like an idiot laughing in the store)!  punctuation.@ i dont get it. a little help?@ the northern cardinal is a bright red bird, and was so named because the garb of a cardinal in the catholic church wears red.@ you can watch one (relative, not same species) on @ we started when he was a kitten. hes never gone out without it.@ you dont see a lot of brown cats.@ my favorite flower.@ this was amazing!@ have you tried just saying stop when he starts?  you say stop, he either will or wont stop. if he doesnt, you repeat it. and repeat it. he will get frustrated. he will probably whine and wheedle. the truth is the stretch marks a) are not from stretching  they are misnamed in english, and b) bother him, not you. therefore by definition, they are his problem, not yours. he  has to solve his problem. suggest he look elsewhere. and whenever he starts, say one word: stop.@ now what?  i hope to god they dont put that stuff back on the shelf~@ i strongly suggest discussing this with your medical practitioner in greater detail, as soon as possible. you need good, accurate information, and wise though we are, fellow redditors may not be 100% corrrct every time.@ cabbage.@ it looked like someone was in the cab of the yellow heavy equipment on the trailer.@ i wish i could do that!@ what is it?  a sample size. a considerable and laudable sample size.@ my friend who is an ultrasound tech said sometimes the gender isnt as obvious as youd think. to avoid giving the wrong info, she never says. once she thought she saw a penis but the doctor said it was a girl and it was. she (the doc) said hormones make the labia big sometimes. so maybe this tech just isnt sure.@ excellent response, solid advice.@ we had no sti testing based on our history. if the history is a lie, the children are the ones to suffer.@ i think youre correct!@ solved.@ thank you, that looks spot on.@ wow, thanks for that. now im super curious. (i teach in an elementary school and was afraid it might be a louse).@ the under-reaction is because we all already knew. just because they didnt admit it until now doesnt mean its news to us.@ and when the time comes, as it inevitably must, just show them this post and ask why you must endure harassment and unhappiness for something that they cannot even discern?@ thats the point. *you cant mail ballots to people who dont have an address*. and one cant vote in a district one doesnt live in. so even if you find a new home, you have to change your voter registration to reflect that, and you have to update your government-issued id to show your new address. and with the delays in mail, even if you get a new residence, a new id, and change the registration, there may not be enough time for you to get your ballot and send it back before the election. poor people get evicted, and by no coincidence , the poor tend to be democrats.@ he lets you check his phone.   you do know thats not how trust works, right?    -there are apps that let you hide your actions  -anyone can erase messages -people get burner phones  how long would you want to check his phone?  one year?  twelve years?  when youre pregnant?  when the baby is sick?  read up on cheaters. its rarely a one time thing. there are people who cheat, and people who dont. its very, very rare that it happens once and never again.@ any idea 1) what the design elements mean, and 2) why its embedded in the sidewalk?@ likely solved@ thank you!  do you know what the symbols represent?  it caught me eye because  besides being embedded in plain sight  it vaguely resembles the confederate flag.@ you wrote this out very clearly, especially so if you include the information you added in the comments. now re-read it, and ask yourself:    if i were reading this about someone else, what would i want for her?  if you decide to follow the good advice several others have offered and become more assertive, know that he will get worse before he gets better. *if* he gets better. *it is sort of like a dog that gets tidbits at the table by whining.  if you stop, the dog doesnt know why. it will think this always works. maybe she cant hear me. i know!  i need to whine louder!  no?  i know!  ill bark!* tour husbands behavior will get worse because he expects his method will  *must*  work.   you are with him because  - you have a history  - you feel responsible for his future fate - you feel a little guilty  - you dont want the confrontation of ending it  he is manipulating you, particularly on the latter three points. you dont need me to explain how  you already know. *you* told *us*.   he will be a big baby about it if you decide to take control of your life, whether that entails staying but asserting yourself, or leaving. but hes already a big baby.  thats not something you control.   you can only change you.@ this!@ this is actually pretty funny!@ what the fuck!@ such love!@ i so glad you found her!@ thank you, thats much clearer now. maybe sketch what you have in mind and post that for responses. im sure others have better imaginations than i do, but an image might help you get the answer youre seeking. good luck!@ like ~ the @ you dont know how to express your feelings?  but you do!  you did it beautifully in this post!    my suggestion would be for you to write it in your neatest handwriting, in a simple card that says nothing more than thank you on it. you dont need to search for a card that expresses your feelings, you just need to share them with him, just as you did here. and include *all of this!*  yes, even the part he already knows.   (if your handwriting sucks, like mine does, type it up and select a nice font that looks like nice handwriting, and enclose it in the card.)  i have received a few heartfelt thank you cards in my life, and i treasure them. i pull them out and reread them, and they give me enormous pleasure.   you are correct that overly thanking him all the time would get awkward. so you just keep being nice. if you notice a favorite something (his brand of chewing gum, or his favorite coffee or soft drink), pick it up for him now and then. little things that remind him thats you like him are silent, unobtrusive ways to say thank you.@ you can write a letter, stating exactly what you said in this post, and send it to the doctor, with explicit instructions that they not contact your parents. they can initiate (and by law *must initiate*) contact with child services.   this will be a shit-storm.  be prepared.   do you have friends your age?@ stop referring to him as your step-bother. period. that term has meaning, and in the context of the relationship you two have, that term is meaningless.   what if everything were the same except that your parents hadnt decided to get married?  or what if they got married after you two did?  my point is that it *is* the set up to a joke, so stop setting it up.@ this is the happy ending we woke up for. seriously, this brought tears to my eyes.@ the skill and athleticism are legit; you can see that level by watching mens or womens gymnastics.  my question is: why is it entertaining and fun to watch a real human being beaten?@ valiant attempt.@ there are lots of other reports; i dont know how well they worked. it would be lovely to know.@ the attacker looks deranged. seriously.@ this is true; this is also the euro-centric discovery.  interestingly, other cultures also figured out ways to inoculate. https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/early-chinese-inoculation@ the name vaccinium was used in classical latin for a plant, possibly the bilberry or a hyacinth, and may be derived from the latin bacca, berry, although its ultimate derivation is obscure. it is not the same word as vaccinum \"of or pertaining to cows\".@ they dont have to. no one will go to jail if they simply dont reopen.@ why is beating someone about the head until you render them senseless a sport?@ i would like to remind everyone that the reason congress approved the payments was so that everyone would stay home *because they were better off at home*. safer at home doesnt work if people cant afford to stay home. by making it lucrative to do so, they could remove that obstacle. it is supposed to keep us at home. thats the whole point!@ excellent answer!  thanks!@ this is a brilliant response!@ let her sulk.   dad was heroic. i wish my husband would stand up for me. never, in 28 years, has he. even when my daughter hit me in a similar fit of anger (she slapped my face, same age).   grabbing her, while dramatic, did not harm her. it scared her. she needed something. really. she was spiraling out of control. he stopped it.   life is messy. maybe you wish this had been different. ok, but it wasnt. and its ok this way. life doesnt have to be perfect, or even the closest approximation you can attain.   as for her giving him the silent treatment:  nope. a few hours, maybe. two days?  nope. now its your turn to defend your husband. *you* make her apologize to him for calling him an abuser, a woman beater. thats a damned serious accusation, and could follow him for years.    the phone is a privilege. she needs to understand that. instead of an open-ended/never ending window and/or  instead of a set time, consider rehabilitation effort on her part. you and your husband discuss behaviors that she needs to do to earn it back. its ok if its piecemeal. im not talking about giving her a list of chores. im talking about having her live up to the standards of basic human decency you normally expect. if that includes making her bed each morning, when she makes her bed (without you telling her to), you tell her, i appreciate that you made your bed.  i think thats worth an hour with your phone.  this can go for anything she *should already be doing as a valued and valuable member of your family:* setting the table, or clearing after.  remembering to thank you for supper.  *this must be agreed on by both parents ahead of time so that either parent can reward good behaviors as they occur.  i cant stress this enough.*  the behaviors are regular cooperative family behaviors.  no need for her to jump through hoops. just behave as a 12 year old in your family should behave.@ how are you doing?  i hope the move helped. i think of you and wish you well.@ i wish you could live somewhere else, too.   barack obama once said in an interview that living with his grandparents after his mother died was occasionally difficult because they sometimes said things about black people that (i dont want to put words in his mouth, and this is from memory) made him cringe. (his grandparents didnt have fox news).   we can all look at that and feel inspired. he not only rose above it and managed to still love them (again, they werent as bad as what youre describing), but he managed to live a good life, with a loving family, and an impressive career.   stay strong, and focus on being the best human being you can.@ maybe this isnt as far-fetched as it sounds. the courts recently upheld a   against alex jones for his lies and defamation regarding the massacre at sandy hook elementary.@ this is a wonderful, happy-ending story! thank you for posting it. you did a great job being up-front about your own shortcomings. you probably will make at least one person see the possibility of a life without their abuser.   i hope you continue working on yourself, and find that great person inside. you are definitely on the right path to great happiness and you deserve it.   good luck!@ if you are allowed to watch television, may i suggest that you watch the news on other channels?  feel free to tell them you are trying to broaden your knowledge base to help you be a better student. the best news to watch is probably the pbs news hour. they are the least biased (based on studies of this sort of thing), and if your guardians are nearby, maybe they can soak some of it up. fox news bias is mind-warping. ive lost two sisters to its influence.   i doubt theyll let you watch it without getting apoplectic, tbh.   is there no one else you can live with?  their attitude must hurt, and im really sorry.@ this. every thing you just said.@ who knew they stood plantigrade in the back?  learn something every day!@ nice video capture!@ columbus day, columbus anything. columbus, ohio. columbus, georgia. columbia, south carolina. district of columbia.@ menstrual cups to the rescue.@ even fish?@ this!@ holy shit.@ he can pay better.@ its like singing. some people can do it, even if badly, in public. no one expects that we will force people to perform a solo on stage, though, if they dont want to.@ op, thank you for being so understanding. i would never belittle someone by using the wrong name or the wrong pronoun. but you are correct that we make mistakes and sometimes forget.   sincere question:  how often does one use a pronoun other than you in a face-to-face conversation as a means of referencing the person with whom you are having said conversation?  im having a hard time understanding how this forgetfulness comes up.  maybe if i answer the phone and the person is unavailable, i might say he cant come to the phone when they would have preferred i say they cant come to the phone, and they can hear me from the bathroom which is why they couldnt come to the phone. but really, other than that sort of scenario, how would they know i messed up the pronoun?@ she showed you her hand. you know now (i *hope* this was a revelation and not part of a pattern) how she will react when shes angry enough. the alcohol justifies nothing.   do you want this person raising your children?    just so you know, this is how it will be. raising children can be very stressful at certain moments. when my mother got this stressed, the violence you described was about par for the course toward me and my siblings. my dad was only marginally better.   please. dont do this. move on with your life without her.   call the police. if youre black and in the usa (god i hate to include this), consider hiring an attorney first. your comment about getting shot if the neighbors called the police leads me to assume that you have a valid reason for this fear, which leads me to the inevitable conclusion that you are not white. im so sorry that this additional layer exists, but it does, and we need to protect you as you go about protecting your property and other assets.   please dont continue this relationship. take care.@ nice to see this in daylight. it was dark at feeding time when i was there. nice video, good job!@ solved@ thanks!@ these are about 3 diameter.@ im teasing you gently because you wrote    bread. you probably meant bred.@ what is chitney?@ they survived the cargo compartment!@ they actually arent bread.@ thank you for removing the child before more damage was done. because of these beliefs, she will hound your daughter in this topic *for the rest of her life.* when you arent there, whispered comments, reminders, biblical references.  the bible has tons of   that you almost certainly dont follow, but this one  masturbation  is important to her and she will never be able to let this go.   please be clear with your little girl that she isnt the cause of the marriage disarray.   your wife has issues, as you know. does your church teach this?@ damn. they cut down every last tree in sight!@ im sorry you had to encounter such a disturbing person. please put you mask up over your nose  she wasnt wearing one at all and that puts you at risk. clearly she doesnt socially distance, either. take care man. thats messed up.@ purebred dogs very frequently have health issues. google any breed. doberman?  thyroid. saint bernard and german shepherd?  hip dysplasia. cavalier king charles spaniel? mitral valve disease. you can read more @ the tone of your message here reveals that you are already making excuses for his behavior, and that deep down, you think you are to blame.   being drugged scared you, and it should. but there is a lot between the lines in this post  along with some explicitly stated examples of ongoing control and abuse.   you think you cant make it without him. that youll be poor.   you might be. its not the worst  thing that can happen.   he, on the other hand, chose to reveal the drugging to you. why?    *he wants you to know he drugged you. he wants you to know what hes capable of. he wants you to be afraid.*    he has invested a lot of time and energy into isolating you and creating financial dependence. he clearly does not want you to leave.   you already know he crossed the line. and you know what you must do. several of these posts have given advice about doing it surreptitiously, and soon. they are correct.@ some two years into marriage, i had an epiphany:  my husband was gay. several months after we split, he started accepting it himself. i dont think he was completely unaware. i think he was simply incapable of *being* gay. christian upbringing, yadda yadda. but it was a long time before he openly said he was a gay man. and i cried when he finally did.   not because i was hurt, or angry, but because he had gone through so much pain and so much denial. he must have really suffered having to try to get and maintain arousal on the few times we had sexual intercourse. yeah, i went through a phase of being frustrated and insecure that our sex life was not enough for him, that i was unattractive. figuring out that he was gay was a huge relief for me.   he, on the other hand, had been compelled by social and familial pressure into a relationship that felt abhorrent to him. he loved me, but he could never be attracted to me. if you who are reading this are heterosexual , try to imagine if you were forced into a homosexual relationship with someone whom you liked, even loved  as a friend  and *everyone* expected you to fuck them!  i wasnt repulsive, but sex with me *was* repugnant. so i cried.  i cried for the years of his pain.   yes, i had emotions about it. yes, there were people who looked at me incredulously (especially after he came out and was *not* inconspicuous) and asked insensitively, but couldnt you *tell* he was gay!?  sure, there were times when i resented the time lost (4 years) and the financial strain  long story  but it wasnt just about me.   life is complicated and messy.    your ex needs to get a grip.@ not okay in my book. nonetheless, the headline is misleading. she was placed in juvie for parole violation.  on parole for violence toward her mother. the conditions for remaining at home included homework; the reason she was violent toward her mom in the first place was when her mom tried to get her to do the hw.   the judge says the child is thriving in the controlled environment, and that that is the reason for the continued confinement.  i doubt that very much; the child doesnt agree that she is thriving there.@ your wife is a girl?  you a pedophile?@ poverty will do that, man. try living on minimum wage.@ thank you!@ thank you!@ solved.@ thank you.@ thank you for posting this.  we need these records.@ while this might be cathartic, it may also be dangerous.@ youre too young to have had the most delicious banana variety ever:  the gros michel.@ hes pro-life. just til theyre born, of course.   and the hell with the adults at the schools  teachers, paraprofessionals, janitorial staff, administrators~@ this is the most boring video you can imagine.@ 1) guy starts talking about last nights date. gets to the part where the intimacy starts.  put up your had in the stop position. say, yeah, no.  thats a little too personal, dude.  2) sister starts railing on how useless her husband is.   take one step back, look concerned. say, i get that youre frustrated, but this seems like something youd tell a counselor.  3) older brother starts diatribe about politics. i would like to join in, but he isnt interested in my thoughts, he just wants to hear himself talk.   change position dramatically (eg stand up if you were sitting) as a means to interrupt (must be sudden enough to cause at least a brief stoppage).  say, you should write a book! say it loudly and sound like you are impressed and mean it. then quickly walk away.   the trick is to anticipate and plan.@ ours, too. i recorded it one time. now if i play it where he can hear it, he comes running.@ you already know the answer. if you arent sure, read your post and pretend someone else wrote it.@ i am not suggesting anyone is an asshole. but this is literally one of the problems with exotic pets. obviously it is not the only problem, nor is this the only way invasive species find their way into new habitats.   invasives come in on produce, in , as escaped pets,  and, as you mentioned, released pets.@ crappy article opening. lost interest by first paragraph. take a writing course.@ he spent 10,000 on an engagement ring for previous gf. you dont get squat.   maybe theres a reason she left him.   but theres no reason for him to punish you for his prior relationship.   please. take a break. separate your finances now. you know you arent happy. read your own post and comments.@ and this is how we get invasive species.@ it will be his fault. he is responsible for his actions. shining a light on a bad behavior does not make you responsible for that behavior.   he is a bully. the more he gets away with, the worse he gets.   in an ideal world, she will be horrified, tell you shes so sorry this happened to you, thank you for sparing her the misery of a life with him, and kick his sorry ass to the curb.   do you have any way you can document his behavior before going to your sister?  a phone or ipad you can set up to record in a way that he cant see?  even audio would work.   the fact that he has threatened to escalate if you tell is a red flag that he is dangerous and should be out, period.   im not sure why you didnt tell the first time. that makes me wonder if your own family bullies/belittles you, and you somehow have learned to think you deserve this. you dont. no one does.   can you talk to your mom about this?@ nice irony.@ 100 miles is 161 km. also:  they are huge. i saw them in ecuador, and still cant get over how enormous they are!@ she has a penis, but identifies as a cow.@ ta-da!@ ~ like every other job.@ did you google him?

   shes a grownup. she needs to act like one. she expects that there will be no consequences for her decision to party. i hope shes right with regard to the virus. but she is wrong with regard to disrespecting and endangering you and yours.   let me help a little: you horrible person!  see?  that wasnt so bad. thats really the worst that will happen if you disinvite her:  some words like those.   thats a far cry from the worst that may happen if she attends.   she left you no real choice.   just remember:  this is her doing, not yours.@ who gives a fuck?

(and how did family react?  not too dramatically, i hope!)@ my dad was like this. it started with my moms mother. she never asked, but when she became a widow, he didnt want to see her live in poverty. years later a sister was widowed with three children. almost at the same time, another sister was widowed, with two teenagers still in high school.   many years later, my moms brother (a bum, honestly) moved in with my widowed grandmother; he took care of her, more or less, but had no income. dad helped him, too.   we had less than we would have, but we were never hungry nor homeless. my relatives would have been. i never resented any of them, and certainly not my dad. i was proud of him for stepping up.   your fiancs relatives need financial guidance, no doubt. but maybe you can appreciate what he is: generous. approach solutions from a position of pride  in him. genuine, not feigned to give you better leverage.   instead of looking at him as needing your help to figure out how to handle thee awful relatives on your terms, be grateful that he has compassion and kindness, even when it frustrates him. be on his side. he needs that, not a wedge between him and his family. try viewing these people with love and not resentment, and support his decisions.@ with a handy label that says, nest.@ you are both correct. the poisons, unfortunately, do not deter illicit drinking if the mixture, hence the addition of denatonium.   fun fact:  denatonium is used in a tincture designed to deter fingernail biting. i found the taste strangely appealing when my father decided to apply it to my nails to stop me biting them.@ and since soaps/shampoos are basic, they also contribute to denaturing the proteins in semen.@ why are you trisodium citrate?@ close, but not quite. the perm chemicals (strong bases) attack the disulfide bonds in the proteins.  imagine this as several lines of kids holding hands, say lined up on a football field. the lines are stable as long as they are just standing there. when someone yells go, the kids run around, still trying to hold hands. of course some lines will break apart, even if only a little. then when the whistle blows, they have to grab hands with the nearest person. lines reform, but not in exactly the same order.   the hair is wound around the roller before the chemical is added. the chemicals are the running: they break a few of the bonds.  the rinsing and neutralizer are the whistle: the disulfide bonds reform, but now in a slightly different position. that new shape is permanent (hence perm) unless the bonds are re-broken by another application of the strong base.   the same principal is at work for hair removal chemicals. its a stronger base, more concentrated, and allowed to remain in place until most of these bonds are broken, weakening the hair enough that it will a fall out.   humidity and perms have nothing to do with each other.  the mechanism for hair curling/frizzing in humidity is unrelated.@ living without them@ squinting to lift the bags  it makes them less noticeable.@ wow!@ you were right to move on.@ ignores you. wait til you have kids. really want to marry him now?@ several people have said that canids are pack animals (i looked it up). in fact, only about half of the species in this family live in packs.  so i dont think that is the answer.   tree-climbing  or inability to  is an an interesting hypothesis.@ read another post earlier same day  she waited eleven years, they fought about it and now theyre engaged and shes unhappy. really, read it. thats where youre going if you stay.@ im sorry.   he doesnt want things to change. he is doing the absolute minimum to keep you there so that things wont change. you are so heavily invested, time-wise and emotionally, that you cant bring yourself to leave.   you know who he is. eleven years. if you arent happy with who that man is, thats okay. but you cant expect him to change. even his parents know he didnt want to propose, or they would have been over the moon, like you parents were. your parents were reflecting you, and what they know you wanted. his were reflecting him, and what he wanted. im even willing to bet that he didnt tell them in your presence, so he could convey his real feelings privately.   i left the same situation at the ten year mark.   life does go on. i cant promise anything if you leave, but i can share with you that i met the man i was meant to marry when i was 33. we have a good marriage, have wonderful children together, and will be together til death do us part.   the other guy?  he did, eventually agree to get married. we even went so far as to get a license. he stood me up at the alter so to speak. all the red flags were there. no big wedding, just a judge  his rule. i guess he always thought that it wouldnt really come to that (getting married).  he was right. and he was desperate for us not to break up after that. seriously. i dont know what his issues were/are, but i finally saw the light. i wasted years on him. im just glad i finally quit trying.   if he does marry you now, is he going to resent you?  you already know the answer  look how he gaslighted you about the proposal!  oh he had it all planned but you ruined it. you pushed and broke it!  its all your fault. and that will come up every time you fight.   if you do marry now, are you sure he really wants children?  he doesnt want anything to change now, so i suspect the pregnancies will be the same capitulation as the proposal, and you will never hear the end of how you pushed him when he wasnt ready.   and its true. he isnt ready. he will never be ready.@ i am glad to hear it. i live in the usa. its insane here. i hope you do well there. can you give an update sometime?  (in my best mum voice) i also want to remind you to do a little more than your share while youre there. make them glad you came!@ what was her fate?  please tell me she was convicted of at least something!@ wow. he made it about him.@ you hypocrite!  there.  that wasnt so bad was it?    let them call you a hypocrite. you are right, they are wrong *and they know it.*  just be sure the place you go really *is* better  the last thing you want to do is have to come back with your tail between your legs.  ps. im sorry about your losses.@ inertia.@ anyone else find themselves counting compressions?@ demon eyes.@ senator paul rand (republican, ky) comes to mind. he had a mild case and is now doubling down on the no big deal rhetoric.@ wow.@ my mil does this  to talk to people *in the back seat*!  at speed.  oh, and did i mention that the uses her hands a lot when shes talking?  so ~ neither hand on the steering wheel!@ this pleases me.@ her daughter was a cancer survivor with immune issues *and the mom  a nurse  knew this*. she should be charged with negligent homicide at the least.@ you did a good thing standing up to him and standing up for you sister. you both did the right thing to call the police and to get out.   im really sorry that you have had to live with someone like this. from your story, i cant tell how long this sort of behavior has been occurring, nor whether youve endured abuse before, but i suspect you have. im glad you got out.   im also sorry for your mom. i hope she can see her way to leave. i hope you eventually work it out to have a loving relationship with her, but for now, shes in a bad place mentally and *she* has to do that work.   if its possible, please look into getting some counseling. you will benefit, and so will your sister. someday you will be an adult, maybe pissed at your own children, and if you have only this sort of example lurking around in your subconscious about what adults do when they are angry, you may find yourself re-enacting his abuse. moreover, you need to have a chance to really appreciate how utterly dysfunctional he is, and how brave you were to put a stop to it.   with time, you can learn to handle assholes like this without escalating. but you are young, and you did a good thing for your sister. (and what the f**k difference did it make if he thought the groundhog was pregnant?  how does that justify forcing yourself sister to watch him disembowel the poor, dog-mangled animal?)@ you are intelligent. you sound like you may have adhd  treatable with medication. as an adult with adhd you will need to learn how to be more organized, something the medication will help you accomplish. (it wont make you more organized  you still have to learn how to do that, and there are some excellent books on the subject).  my advice to you is that you step back from the current situation for a while, see a doctor about getting diagnosed (if thats what it is  there are other learning disabilities that can also be treated) and get moving on the thing you gave up on so long ago:  your education. you wrote a clear, lucid story. everyone reading it is struck by the same thing:  you have a good mind.   please understand that what he is doing is a reflex on him, not on you. he is being a jerk. period.   consider moving on.   i left a ten-year relationship in almost the exact same circumstances. he was getting his phd, i had dropped out of undergrad. i dont know why i did, but i left. my life has gotten better every year. i look back and see how utterly miserable he was, and how he looked down on me, the contempt~  we werent married, and had no kids, which made it easier to leave.   married 25 years now. i finished my bachelors. my husband finished his masters and phd, and he never once felt the need to put me down for having less education.@ and no sex. thats a really effective birth control.@ moist butt, soft/fuzzy tp, friction rubs some off, it rolls around the hairs and forms little balls, like the pills you see on sweaters. these are now tangled in the hairs, and are a pain to remove. pretty much have to shower them off. not all soft tp does this, though.@ duly chastised.@ her. fucker cutting *herself* a piece of meat.@ sort this out before the decisions about bridesmaids come up.@ other commentators have offered great advice. also consider that because this is part of a group, your fiance may not want to break up the whole group, and may fear losing everyone if she moves away from rachel. (theres a good chance others in the group feel the same way).   you mentioned hearing the group chat.  what are the others like?  are they abused by rachel, too?  do they abuse one another?  does anyone stand up for anyone who is being abused, regardless of who is doing it?    you may be able to focus on some of the others in the group, point out nice, supportive things they do/say, and without ever even mentioning rachel, provider a contrast. (jenny was so nice tonight!  i really like the way she laughs at your jokes!  tarnisha compliments her shoes? tanisha has great taste in shoes!).   i had a friend like rachel. she was so quick with the insults, and sometimes i didnt even realize until later how much she had put me down in a single conversation/evening. we had friends in common, and avoiding her would have meant not being with any of them. we hung out together as a group in college. it was hard. her comments still sting sometimes, years later, even though i can honestly say i understand rationally that she was just an abusive person, emotionally it still hurts. even now, i wonder why no one else stood up for me. (one man did, one time, when i had been reduced to tears).  hes still a friend. all the others faded away. and im glad to be free of them.@ im really sorry. i have this experience with one of my sisters, and, sadly, with my husband. everyone does it sometimes. these two so it all the time, like your parents. it sounds like your brother is a bit of an asshole, too.  i mean, why isnt he conversing with you, or redirecting conversations that get left dangling?    the worst thing for me is that these are people i feel should love me, but hurt me this way. i can imagine you feel the same way. im a senior citizen, and i can assure you this never stops. you cant change them. you just cant.  but you can change you. change what you can, accept what you cant.  move on to happier listeners, people who listen and *be sure you listen back*.@ when you are a bit (ie not severely) dehydrated, the urine is more concentrated, which can stimulate the same reaction as a full bladder. normally the stretch receptors in the bladder wall are the cue. other factors causing the sensation of needing to pee can include psychological input, including nervousness or fear.@ i call bullshit.@ this is good advice.@ it went on for two hours.  during which time she should have sobered up a least a little. but she was still nutso?    that you maintained a semblance of normalcy for two hours of drunken abuse is commendable. you  appear to have handled it as well as possible.   please dont allow yourself to think this was a one-off situation. no one deserves this, it was violent and dangerous enough *before* she threatened to call the police. she may yet. she may feel a need to justify her behavior when (and of course she will) rehashing this with her mom or with friends. they will then press her to report the abuse she will claim. do not, under any circumstances, destroy the video. if you already deleted it, look to recover it (check the deleted photo album). the penalty for recording someone who doesnt know (if you are in a two-party consent state) is far less than the penalty for abusing a girlfriend.   you need at least some evidence that you were calm and just trying to get her out.   never be alone with her again. never.@ do not delete the video.@ hairy butt.@ good question. it has to do with the one doing the action (as opposed to the one ordering the action), and whether there is an object being acted on. so if you want your dog to assume a prone position, you say, lie down.  the dog is the one doing it.  if you want someone to place the dog somewhere (say you are a vet and you want the tech assisting you to put an unconscious dog up on the examination table), you would say lay the dog on the table.  in that case, the dog is the object being acted on.  it gets slightly more complicated in this example:  first, im going to lay a book on the table. i say lay, not lie. but the book is lying there, not laying there. once the action is completed, the book is lying there, on its own, no longer the object of an action (because the action has ended).   but because english sucks, the past tense of lie is lay. no shit.@ so they removed her makeup and false eyelashes before slamming her to the ground?@ these two photos show no one in common. i guess all black people look alike to some~@ lie. you lie, not lay. to lay is to place. you lay an object.   if this grammar lesson doesnt bring out a few innuendos~@ he needs to move out. he doesnt know he needs that, so you should help him. pack his things and put them on the porch or on the curb.   whos lazy now?@ this is a laughing gull. and it has something to laugh about.@ thats how we run public k-12 schools in the usa. unlike many other countries, we have no streaming for which kids go to which type of school.@ ummm~thats the point of this post.@ also, average iq for any country is 100. thats how its normed.@ also try inaturalist. great app for identifying anything living (and sometimes dead).@ no masks.@ young and attractive. that right there is the problem.@ definitely needs an editor. the further you read the more errors.@ of course its reasonable.@ my first husband was gay. it was a long time ago. it was still illegal in most states. he *tried* to be hetero. he didnt know, then he *couldnt* know. his dad was a minister. i figured it out. and i set us both free.  he came out and lived happily til he died. we stayed friends, but it was hard at first.   good luck. this is hard but necessary. and you can do it.@ and if theres a pregnancy ~ will you ever be able to free yourself from the question whos the father?  if theres a venereal disease~ is that fair to your brother?  and for gods sake, she was sharing gems in the age of covid-19.   and now shes headed to visit?  some have suggested that you tell her to come clean to him.   i have a friend who did that. they moved past it. got married. raised a daughter. still happy 24 years later. one mistake. but she told him. and never did it again.@ worked for me.@ while cutting their entitlements, like social security.@ when he loses, he has 6 weeks to resign and turn the keys over to pence who can pardon him and the kids. if he wins he gets to wait out the statute of limitations.@ what is that thing?@ being restless is not a mental illness. its not common, thats all. maybe, if youre so inclined, youll find someone to be restless with. my grandmother was like that. so am i. i moved and changed jobs and schools and partners *for two decades* until one day, i found the perfect person:  another restless soul.  were great together. we have raised a family, have lived on four continents, in probably 17 homes (including 6 months in a car traveling around africa). i dont regret a single day.  almost everyone i know has expressed doubt about our lifestyle. my family used to shake their heads in pity for my failure to settle down.  but we arent all cut from the same cloth. try it and see. my only advice is that you embrace it. sometimes it was hard, especially at first. but this is who we are. (this isnt our last stop, barring death.).   best of luck.@ thugs. on my payroll (taxes).@ yes.@ please please please tell me where this was filmed.@ the us army did this after photos of us soldiers abusing prisoners embarrassed them. @ when you said that rebecas mom was an absent mom, my first thought was that the dad must have been even worse not to even garner a mention. worse in this case can mean anything  not trying to blame but to say he is more absent than mom. he could be dead for all i can tell. so that leaves a lot of room for ~ well, men. was the mom involved with a bad dude , or a string of them?  were there johns in the picture?  drug dealers?  abusers?    bottom line, she doesnt like you. but it may have nothing to do with *you*. it may simply be that she doesnt know *how* to like men/ males. she may have no experience with pleasant adult men. or no pleasant experiences with adult men.   take it slowly, as you are. dont push, and dont take it personally. i can tell this makes you sad, but my sense is that shes just unable to make the connection. i know this may be painful for you, or maybe just weird, but just be yourself and allow her to be who she is. she may need some healing time.   have you considered finding a therapist for the family?  just someone to talk through some of these thoughts and someone she can see (alone) to work through what must be some difficult times?    thank you, btw, for taking her in.\n",

fact, guys who grew up with sisters (whether theyre older/younger) *do* make better boyfriends than guys who grow up without.  they have a home team advantage.@ its like that guy at the bar who

you can go to community college for 1/4th of the price.  paying $10,000 a semester (not including books $800-1,000, rent $655-$1200, food $200 a month) vs $1,000 ($250-300 in books, rent $500-$700,

fat, very fearless and will have zero qualms about chewing a hole into your backpack to get your snacks.@ ikr? the scotts have better skirts than this.@ not sure if i like the tall socks paired with a skirt but i feel like they could do a better cut instead of making them look so baggy.@ but the human face is different!!1!! we need it uncovered bc otherwise i wont wash my face as often!! /s@ ikr?  like no one said you had to wear the same one without washing it. also upping your skincare routine bc of masks would be common sense but you know, thats too difficult ig.@ wtf is he smoking? is it crack? because it sounds like crack and bath salts to come up with this theory.@ i hope that 16 year old stays the hell away from him and her parents scares him off too.@ i was thinking the same thing! kid just needs to grow his hair out a little and work on his skincare routine and hes gucci.@ this is why i gave up on words with friends. too many creeps.@ the scotts had it right the first time, men in kilts/skirts look fine af.@ so she definitely dodged a bullet.@ idk if it helps but i went from d to a b/a (bc sizes are never consistent) with deadweight lifting.  you probably cant exercise right away bc if the surgery but something to consider if you want to try and get some more weight off your back.@ you stumped him.@ family: assholes about it and said i lost everything physically desirable  friends: very supportive   male strangers: definitely gave me more attention   female strangers: did not care for me@ this guy is shooting himself in the foot; *she* initiated contact, *she* made plans to hang out with him voluntarily and hes going to ruin it by trying to fuck. smh@ carry mace and talk to your security (if you have any stationed) in your store abt what this guy looks like and to inform you if they come in again.   you can never be too careful.@ i would recommend having a talk with hr if there is one for your chain bc thats 100% unprofessional and no one gets a sick stomach/soils themselves on purpose.@ grown ass men will complain abt wearing a mask for 20-30 mins in an air conditioned store but ignore ppl who have to wear it outside for 6-8hrs just make some  money who can wear a mask properly with no complaints.  they weak af.@ who said they would be dead? i meant buried alive 6ft under.@ its a sad state of affairs that anyone has to put up with this.@ i hate when guys pull this shit on dating sites.@ the only place maps/pedos belong is 6ft under.@ karens come in all colors and sizes@ probably both. i was just glad to never see him again on campus or at mixers bc you cant unhear/unsee that train wreck.@ everyone else at the mixer was thinking the same thing bc *holy hell* bc if he wasnt drunk/high on something theres no sane being that would say that in a public setting but on the same note this was fl in the early 2000s.@ ive literally witnessed in college how a guy that was drop dead gorgeous (without the influence of alcohol)who couldve had anyone at the mixer instantly become the most undesirable guy there bc his opening line to a group of women he approached was, no need to fight ladies, you can all suck my dick one at a time by tits size, the one that can make me cum gets anal.  regardless if it was supposed to be a funny ice breaker or not he was ejected from the mixer about 20 mins in bc his following pick ups were worse.  i think he got banned bc i never saw that guy at the mixers again or maybe i got lucky.@ everything thats worth having takes effort; a healthy mind, body and relationships take effort. even love at first sight takes effort to maintain bc lusting after a pretty face is easy, keeping them interested in you as a person for the long run is the challenge.@ or the 2nd most common complaint, i have prey eyes and a weak chin!!@ you can still do all those things with her as an adult with the added bonus of: no curfew, no borrowing hers/your parents car, you can drink adult beverages, she most likely has contraceptives, not limiting dates to your combined allowance(s) bc you both (hopefully) have jobs and (hopefully) your own places to netflix and chill.@ i think shes hispanic. could be mixed tho.@ this is confusing, obviously theyre related but was the sister trying to sell her dads stuff behind his back or is something else going on?@ god i wish it was only 9 times a year.@ old ppl bitch about needing to be thanked for everything while the younger generations know its *expected* to do things like this without being prompted/thanked.@ i still highly doubt thats his pic tho. too many guys are out there catfishing with an insta models pics.@ he states with a close pic of a muscled torso that probably isnt his and no face pic.@ they truly are, and they always think theyre the *only one* to think of asking for something they know they arent entitled to like stroller parking in the parking lot (which does not exist on disney property and about 98% of guests have kids so even if we did it wouldnt last) or faking an injury/grievances do they can get a reservation for a booked out restaurant.  you can to a theme park and not just any theme park but the theme park.  you cant plead ignorance that you didnt know you couldnt lick our windows/doors for clout, or make reservations when its plastered all over our online sites that its 100% necessary to get in or that you will in fact, have to *walk* in our park unless you rent a scooter.  i thought i saw enough karens and entitled ppl in retail but i was wrong, theme parks are the breeding grounds of karens.@ as a cast member i can confirm there are *many* parents that think just like her and think just bc theyre an annual passholder that they should have all the privileges.  its not like 85% of our visitors arent pass holders themselves who also paid to have a good time without acting like a self entitled brat.@ drag his ass even if granny already dumped his pedo ass.@ when it comes to desperate guys everything, including professional networking sites and forums strictly for cancer patients/survivors are dating platforms.@ kindles and phones have curves too.@ i forget what it stood for but i know it had to deal with our customer surveys that would print every 3rd receipt.  if the scores were too low (and they always were) corporate would be breathing down our necks bc that stupid score was always more important than us beating our projected sales for the day or keeping our theft down.@ bc the original managers would have told her to fuck off since we have a 30 day return policy but new manager thought this was a *great* opportunity to show that bending the rules would create a lifetime customer and boost our smg scores.  it created a leech of a karen who would later try to return things we dont even sell and a drop in our satisfaction scores bc she would always complain to corporate.  all in all the manager should not have appeased the karen.@ better to make these mistakes now then wait until shes 30. her hair will grow out.@ we had a lady try to return a lacy nightie she bought from a sister store in another state, 3 years ago, on sale ($9.99) but expected to return it for its full price of a whopping $12.99 just bc she had the receipt.  that thing was torn and nasty but since the newly appointed manager wanted to show us whose boss she got to return it anyway but only for the sale price.@ can someone please explain to me *where* in the bible it projects that a cashless society is the sign the end is near? i know i was stuck in sunday school until middle school but i dont remember any of that.@ listen, if hes comfortable in that outfit more power to him.  2020 is already a shit year might as well let him wear what makes him feel good.@ as a survivor i dont owe them a fucking thing but anger and disgust.  so miss me with that help them bs.@ let the baby keep the box!!@ youre right it doesnt change anything but enough outcry/support against ppl who think like the pedo apologist in the pic will definitely make any pedo think twice before trying to groom/molest/rape a child.  if they understand that theres a mob waiting to beat them to a pulp theyre less likely to do it.@ its funny how ppl go from save money turn off lights/appliances when youre not using them to turning off lights/appliances is socialist control just bc any authority recommends that they do so.  why do they feel the need to rebel when its common sense you can plainly see in your next bill?@ doesnt matter if we dress like nuns or a stripper ppl will still make gross comments bc ppl like to forget that if you dont have something nice to say dont say it at all and if you couldnt say it to your mother and not get slapped you shouldnt say it to strangers either.@ i sincerely hope this person doesnt have a younger sister but if they do, i am more than willing to be the older sibling they deserve and beat the ever loving shit out of any adult that wants to have a sleepover with her.@ things that cause constipation:  eating foods low in fiber.  not drinking enough water (dehydration).  not getting enough exercise.  changes in your regular routine, such as traveling or eating or going to bed at different times.  eating large amounts of milk or cheese.  stress.  resisting the urge to have a bowel movement.  not one of those things is due to an overconsumption of meats or spicy foods.@ swquak box, a microphone attached to the sound box like a tour guide might use to direct big groups of ppl.  its generally effective with most ppl unless theyre one of those assholes who think theyre made of steel and wont be crushed by oncoming traffic.@ we have pads of paper/pen in case we get someone hard of hearing and we had a turtle box too until it broke.  we just gotta do what we can@ do they really think ppl cant wash their face, brush their teeth or apply chapstick before/after they wear a mask?@ and not hound ppl for nudes or try to sext 6 texts in.  like how difficult is it to carry on a conversation thats barely a day old without begging for nudes or to watch you get off??@ bold of them to assume that out of 100 women that none of them would be bisexual, lesbian or asexual.@ alright ill try that and see how my hair fares. thank you!@ i use pantene moisturizing shampoo/conditioner.  i dont brush my wet hair with a brush i use a wide comb in the shower but the amount of hair im getting from it scares me bc i know my maternal granny is nearly bald at the top of her head.  my job is picky about hair ties but i dont use the ones with metal clasps bc they always get trapped in my hair.   i havent thought to use a heat protectant tho bc i though they were generally for when you blow dry/curl hair.   is there a shampoo/conditioner you recommend to keep hair from getting dry and not shed with every wash?@ thats fortunate, i just wish it was like that here stateside.   i know its different like that when i visit family in japan but its just so difficult not to tip bc i know at home its what they depend on for wages to feed themselves/family.   it should be like that worldwide.@ this is why all bars/pubs/restaurants need ppl to sign waivers that no, the staff are not hitting on you bc they were polite and laughed at your shitty joke, they are not interested in you bc they smiled at you and are *definitely* not dtf just bc they put up with you being handsy bc theyre just doing their job and working for that tip.  i know 2020 is a shit year but can we at least as a society grow the fuck up and realize that employees are only nice to you bc its *their job*  also they shouldnt have to work for tips and should be paid a fair wage.@ i was about to say it was reading a bit funny@ rapture watchers now that *reeks* of another divine death cult coming this way.@ anything that is the equivalent to [insert someone elses child] is doing [whatever milestone/activity] better/faster than you followed by all the shortcomings they can name bc *in their day ppl did* nonsense.  just being a constant critic.@ im surprised they let her in at all. they shouldve turned them away from the door bc shopping at ikea is a privilege, not a right.  and wtf has money to be shopping at ikea rn?@ trust your gut bc he probably is a creep. let your sister know whats up in case he tries to hit her up and how to handle it if he does (i.e. get your parents involved.)@ there was a sasha transfer from russia at my high school which we thought was going to be a girl but instead a very tall/husky young adult, michelle, another transfer but a black guy from nice, france and then there was lulu from china who we were *sure* was gonna be a girl but was also a guy.@ good bc holy shit this sounds like something terrible is gonna happen@ good call!  your babys health in the first week are more important than anyones feeling about vaccines especially when theyre keeping your baby safe.@ unfortunately there are plenty of dumbass children in adult bodies who ask this question not only on reddit but on other platforms like twitter, words with friends, youtube comments and ofc fb.  there is no escape@ why do guys gotta be like this and ask some variation of the shower with the opposite sex question?@ its a trap. im almost 100% certain this is a trap.@ wtf?@ someone sounds like a weakass bitch if she thinks 9 months of back pain, nausea, mood swings, food cravings, swollen ankles, weak bladder, getting kicked randomly, being approached and *touched* by strangers who just want to feel the baby, dont be so *sensitive* about it isnt worse than wearing 5 inches of cloth over her mouth/nose for 20 minutes while harassing employees bc they dont have the avacodo dip she likes.@ they need to leave stephanie alone especially since robby rotten is the *real* heartthrob of the show.@ lets be honest, most dms or compliments  *are* them being thirsty. wtf else are you hitting up someone you have no friends in common with and probably young enough to have fathered/birthed.@ gross. guy must have too much time on his hands to be harassing teenagers on reddit.@ i thought that asshole deleted.@ did he have a stroke or is his voice/text really that bad?@ geraldo lets not sexualize children.  hes a *kid*, let him have that before someone starts a  countdown until hes legal.@ #same@ she could be. either way drop the convo and find someone who actively wants to be a part of otherwise youre wasting your time.@ bc they pretty or not theres always new messages from thirsty guys who want to meet *right now* and cant respect that some ppl only want a friendship online.@ shes most likely a catfish bc if shes real youre not the only one trying to shoot their shot in her inbox.  just assume that if theyre that pretty and you dont originally find them on insta theyre a catfish.@ shes not interested bc shes only doing one worded responses or shes a bot. idk how long your convo was before this pic but asking for an insta 3 messages in?@ i get plenty of offers for free! [doubt.jpeg]@ so he gets to pick the girl based on her photos but she doesnt get the same courtesy bc she should love him for him and not his looks.  either way his pedo ass needs to find someone his own age to put up with his bs.@ how not to get a 2nd date 101. what an asshole!@ this is why i dont accept conversations from anyone on messenger im not already friends with. idc if we have 1 common friend prior, if youre hitting me up out of the blue its more than likely not gonna end well.@ idk why lazy town was pasted on the pedos shirt and at this time im too afraid to look into and find out. pls tell me sporticus is in the clear.@ oh no, now they wont continuously thirst/demand petite gfs/wafuis.  how ever will us petite women ever handle that *level* of rejection?  we are *ruined* /s@ lets be real tho, we all secretly hoped to meet someone as accepting as prince eric, willing to learn like tarzan, respectful like hercules, willing to change like prince adam, kind/generous like aladdin and willing to follow his heart to be with the random lady singing in the forest like prince phillip.@ but i fed and clothed you for at least 16 years!! you owe me for that!!  thats what parents *do* at a minimum.  youre not getting a reward for doing the *bare minimum* just bc you didnt let a kid starve to death.@ fucking hate that shit sooooo much.@ i loved my babysitters more than i loved my parents and considering i spent more hours at the sitters house than my own as a kid 0-8 its not a wonder why.@ its stupid is what it is.   we dont deserve this bs. hopefully youre in a position to not live with yours anymore and if not hang in there bc it got better for me to ignore/block her when i moved out.@ this is gonna be my dad after he finally gets a job in over 16years.  i know it will be bad for my moms finances bc shes the only one working but id be lying if i didnt think it would be satisfying seeing my dad facing the consequences of his behavior.@ this is my relationship with my mom 100%.   im feeling good about the way i look that i actually check myself out when passing a mirror? narcissism.  i feel good about my handy work and post it to social media to show some relatives that live far away(and actually encourage/love me) and im being boastful pos.   take some fun snapchat filters and how did she birth such a vain creature?!!  wtf do moms gotta be like this? cant their kids (daughters especially) just appreciate themselves? its not like the world at large ever will.@ promises, promises karen.@ you complain about one for dressing immodest, youll complain about the other being a prude, but the one thing that they both share in common is that theyll *never* send you nudes.@ my condolences to you on having such a shitty asshole for a brother and to your parents who tried their best.  hopefully mr. im owed shit finds someone else to screech to.@ or they could teach their kids how to deal with strangers and how to handle a kidnapping situation instead of acting like kids are incapable of learning *how* to keep themselves safe.@ dumb fucks like her will be the reason well be wearing masks in january.@ good luck getting a job with those tattoos bc its gonna be a bitch to cover up with makeup and any sane place is gonna look at you and nope out.@ whoever this is, i hope they have a shitty day bc god knows how many ppl are struggling to keep even a rented roof over their heads during the pandemic and all this jackass is thinking about how to kick them out.@ its never free bc they always expect to get to 1st or 2nd base for a $5 coffee otherwise youre just looking for a free meal.  this is why its better to go dutch.@ she does realize thats standard procedure for a doctors office right?  taking temperatures, especially during a pandemic, are *vital* before you do anything bc we dont want to spread the infection to other immune compromised bodies.  but i guess shes gonna be like this until someone she loves contracts something serious.@ thats a croissant and possibly a hotdog.@ lets hope it gets taken down soon.@ and rapey.co is allowed to exist because~?@ great for the ladies and men!@ ill even take pics of completed gundam sets, literally *anything* but your genitals is a better pic to send.@ if they wanted a reaction they couldve just posted a cute cat/dog pic. 100% more respectful and who doesnt love cats/dogs?@ im gonna guess that op wanted a cosplay woman to post some personal wank material for him or wanted her to act/be his anime wafui and she said no.@ minor or not he knew what he was doing was wrong especially if he has only one more year left in high school.  boy needs to learn that his actions have consequences and not everything is like a discord chat room when playing 1st person shooter.@ yup and not just on dating apps.@ then definitely get hr and corporate involved. you gave her a time/dated 2 weeks notice and you should no longer need to be scheduled. dont worry about any consequences of them not becoming a recommendation when you look for another job bc your manager was in the wrong.  if anything your manager will be under review for bumbling up a 2 weeks notice.@ listen, after you put in your 2 weeks notice make a 2nd copy of what you gave her time and dated.  if she tries to put you on the schedule again and she calls you remind her that you have a copy of what you gave her and youre not supposed to be on schedule when youve already quit. if she keeps calling escalate to hr bc she cant schedule someone thats already quit.@ new kitty acquired!@ at least this answers my question of did dumbasses really fight the seatbelt law and no shirt, no shoes, no service laws the same way with mask mandates.@ my condolences to its citizens.@ even fl has enough sense to make seatbelts and helmets mandatory. wtf is with nh?@ ah, thank you.@ wtf is it not legal to wear a seatbelt in a car?  i thought it was pretty much standard for everyone one in the car to have a seatbelt not just the driver and whoever is riding shotgun.@ icp merch?@ heres to hoping she never comes back@ oof. even worse@ this was my parents neighbor before they moved. they had a 3 car garage, a regular driveway and a circular driveway.  despite only having 3 vehicles and a golf cart (which they werent legally able to drive anywhere bc its not a golf neighborhood) they still *insisted* they didnt have enough space to park their vehicles in their driveways and *had* to park in front of our property.  they would consistently try to move their cars to block my parents house to the point where trash ppl couldnt see the branches that needed to be collected or the trash bin and kill the grass.  so my dad would start accidentally tossing garbage into the bed of his truck to get his ass back on his own property bc the cops couldnt do much but fine the neighbor.@ definitely a scammer who wasnt going to pay in the first place.@ now thats what we need, money sanitizer or sanitation uv light.@ idk about you but thats a red flag early in the game.  if youre still keen on this guy play it careful and set those hard boundaries fast.@ ive had guys do this on words with friends and its annoying af.@ youd think a man that supposedly put himself thru law school could learn how to spell real words.@ his bitch ass only took the mask off once the flight attendant passed him bc if he did it in front of her he wouldve been kicked off like the last karen.@ well, im never handling cash again. boob/pants money is gross but your *teeth*?!@ fire sign is accurate tho@ we suffer the same thing at my work. bc shorts are too distracting and arent the proper look for women to wear we have to wear company skorts.     in all varieties of fl weather. the *men* get to wear shorts but the women-no, thats a mans uniform!@ this is my uncle in ky.    obese, health conditions and collects guns like a 90s kid with pokmon cards but is so *certain* when the great reckoning comes hes gonna come out like rambo.@ if theyre so concerned about their child not being identifiable they could always, you know, make them a custom personalized mask like they probably do with their backpacks, lunchboxes and shirts.   or better yet, keep an eye on your damn kids and teach them on how to stay safe when strangers approach them.@ i know her child needs help.@ ah yes, bc i value personal safety and hold ppl accountable for threats, i must be a little bitch. totally makes sense. /s@ whatever station is close to you bc at least it will start a paper trail if the idiot does try anything.  i doubt it but better safe than sorry.@ time to make a report at the station. you never know with crazies like that dude.@ your mom is insane. wtf would you spray/slap someone for putting a *bottle* in the wrong place?@ ok that makes more sense bc i thought the sis didnt live with them. then he definitely shouldnt go bc theres always next year.@ well thats dumb. he can go without his sis all they really need to do is film or facetime the try outs so shes giving support.@ hades> poseidon> zeus@ lay off drugs.@ idk why shes mad about having personal space at an outdoor concert.  id *love* to have enough space to bring chairs, cooler and legroom without worrying about it being trampled/lost.@ wtf cant they just film the tryouts like normal parents and send it to you?  why do they act like you physically have to be there in order to see/support him? also praying/hoping you wont suffer the worst of the aftermath of surviving the 2020 plague.@ i really hope he didnt pay a professional for those and more importantly *why*?@ god i remember my gym teacher telling this joke during math class.@ lacrosse@ bc theyre big ass babies that are used to getting what they want/when they want who believe you guys have an unlimited stock in the mystical corners of the back room.@ they [private businesses] have a right to refuse service *especially* when it concerns dress code.  he can either adhere to it or shop somewhere else.@ god *forbid* they cant spread their germs and stupidity to the masses at large just so they can yell at a minimum wage worker for not getting their fast food order right/quick enough.@ ppl who do these are hoes and not the good kind.  closing time means *closed* not go on your 5th lap around the store.@ he didnt commit suicide either.@ my parents had one before i was born and would play their records on it like disneys disco duck or weird al records for my younger brothers and i. we know how to work one.@ i hate that so much.   like mom, theres not just photographic evidence of your daisy duke shorts, bra less shirts, bleached perm and questionable makeup choices posing on a truck-you left video proof as well.  proof that i can still access at any time, on any device when you decide your adult daughters shorts arent long enough or the shirt is too thin that you can see the  faint outline of the bra.   and yet shell still try to claim that she was never a degenerate bc those were different times so dress like a nun and dont have fun.@ yeah but its been a hot minute since something like thats happened vs fl having either karen or fl man doing/saying something stupid/racist.@ why does it always have to be fl? why cant it be wisconsin or south carolina?@  its 2020 we shouldnt mutilate a newborns genitals for the aesthetic, religion or bc youre too lazy to learn how to clean their privates properly.  let babies grow into semi adults before you permanently decide to alter their body.@ youd be surprised at what social media accounts kids have nowadays. and while it is highly annoying that hiring companies will scrounge thru those channels looking for dirt i dont doubt that the parents of the girl in question directly tagged/named her making it very easy to find it later. im just saying that sometimes parents post things that can/will have an effect on their kids futures bc they thought they were sticking it to the man/being a rebel.  im not saying this as a never post anything with your child argument im just saying parents should be careful of what images they post with their kids on the internet bc it can have an effect their lives down the road just like giving them an unfortunate name like harry d. dick.@ idk where you stand in chain of command but i wouldve gotten a manager or anyone with higher seniority to take her shit.  lord knows you dont deserve any of the venom shes spitting at you for following protocol. heres to hoping that it isnt fraud and you keep your job @ its going to be difficult for her to get a job when she gets older. your parents can try to delete it all they want but the internet is forever.  hope this fuck you picture was worth it.@ they *do* realize we work more than 40hrs a week at 2 or more job just bc how fucking expensive rent/tuition/everything is right?!@ i despised running go backs for multiple areas bc my old store was a cesspool for thieves and there was *always* that one person who had to pull this shit.  like no, im not following/watching you.  ive got this buggy full of shit ppl didnt want/returned that needs to be put away before i get called back to the register and try to reset my own department.  we cant do shit about you stealing anyway so keep your youre following me bc im [insert race here] and just let me do my damn job in peace.@ if he messages back make him prove himself by showing his gfs fb or his own. that way you can send the messages to the gf or better yet his family.@ i was about to say theyre both expensive.@ oh no dont you *understand*? youre not *only* supposed to just walk in there, talk to the store manager and get the job but also afford a house, feed a family of 4 and pay off your tuition before youre 30 bc what is inflation and requiring a bachelors degree to work at a publix supermarket? /s@ my uncle has this on his fb page.  i gave up explaining that the government already tracks when/where you are based on what you buy/post/call/etc.@ they always have to shoot themselves in the foot trying to make it sexual too fast@ when i was in retail my grandpa passed and my company wouldnt give me time off for the funeral without firing me and i had already used up my sick time.  so obviously i was upset/10 secs from bawling and this fucking douche at the register decides its his sworn duty to tell me it cant be *that* bad, smile!  i lost it and had to sit in the back for 20 mins to collect myself while the customer is trying to defend himself in front of a line of other customers who could *clearly* read a room. i didnt get a lunch for sitting on company time.  my condolences all the same.@ what *are* they smoking and where can i get some?@ ^this! had a coworker that was from ny that their pay was $10 minimum wage but had been forced to transfer to fl where our (at the time) was $7.25.  she made the company pay her the same pay hourly as if she was still in ny and you can bet that the company was desperate to find a way to fire her ass in fl bc she was making more than the managers.  it took them only 6 months to harass her to the point of quitting bc how they treated her. shes in a better place now.@ think rodent park@ she probably designed it herself from micheals.@ god also taught us to not ignore his miracles and blessings which is exactly what modern science and medicine *are*.  i bet this dumbass still wears a seatbelt tho instead of trusting in god to keep them safe.@ so thats what it looks like right side up!  thank you for clarifying and yes it does look like a commercial metaphor for depression.@ now thats just evil.@ she must live with 6 boys who also have football practice 3 times a week. i cant think of any other reason why she would need all of that otherwise.@ thats-  a strange concept for a mask but still pretty none the less! better than what my work gave us.@ wtf are their parents?  i wouldnt stop at banning the kids, ban the parents too.   give them a real reason to teach their kids how to respect things that arent paid for bc now mom/dad have to go out of their way to get groceries elsewhere.@ its colorful but is it supposed to be a coffee with a big red straw in or something else?@ pay off all debts, pay off my parents debts, buy a house and buy my little brothers cars.@ same. im 5ft and 120lbs. me vs 4 intruders of various height/size= im gonna lose and most likely not come out of this alive.  me+gun vs 4 intruders of various height/size= my chances of survival increase dramatically and i dont lose my shit to ppl who wanted to steal what i earned@ in a mask you cant accuse me of sneering at you when you try to feed me that tired but i cant breathe with a mask on i have *anxiety, asthma, its too hot outside and i wear glasses!!*    bc i promise as someone who also suffers from anxiety, asthma, has to stay outside in the direct sun for 6-8hrs bc ppl dont want to follow the arrows while wearing glasses i am sneering at you and calling you a weak bitch under my breath.@ yes@ her top is so cute!@ that person is crazy this remix of princess aurora on a horse looks great!@ can someone translate this?@ spellcheck is a thing my guy, and even virgin 12yr olds that write smut of their otp paint a more believable story than this.@ i love submissive females@ what asians, latinos, and native americans dont count as diversity?@ shes assuming all of us that were furloughed/shut down during those months received *any* unemployment.  god knows at lot of us are still suffering.@ that he did any of that with that girl at the dance.@ [doubt.jpeg]@ be dramatic bc if you let this continue theyre only going continue to sexually harass you and others. someone has to be brave and step up and speak out. if it makes your male coworkers uncomfortable bc you have boundaries im sure your country has laws against business practices like this.@ if your boss/hr wont take this seriously i would take a step ahead of them and involve the police. if the police wont take it seriously a local news crew would be more than happy to drag him and your company for letting this go on for so long.@ it looks vaguely like cardcaptor sakura@ the internet is free and he obviously has access to it somehow so googling panty pics shouldnt be *that* much of a hardship for him.  kids these days.@ prude= she wont send nudes, provocative pics or sext me@ he is a shelf inspector, hes doing his job.@ oh well that sucks then@ i trust him with my tax return.@ i didnt know there was a sub for that. is it invite only?@ definitely not how youre supposed to network on linkin.  cant believe there are ppl out there that still think women dont get hit on/harassed on all manner of websites including the professional ones.@ thank you! i appreciate your response bc as a avid animal crossing fan it looks too cute to pass up but was kinda concerned about the company itself. ill see if they still have it in stock for a reasonable price. thank you!@ would you recommend aliexpress or have you never shopped with them? bc it looks cute af but ive already been burned by wish and sites like it.@ amazon!?@ it was a pic posted in my fb group. i managed to save the pic bc the rest of what was around it was cringe and had too much identifiable info to mark out.@ a cat was mayor of an alaskan town for 20 years@ and then they wonder why we arent more social or married with kids at this point bc when the fuck would we have had time for that between ap classes, job and taking care of baby sibling while keeping a clean house?  where were we supposed to find the time for ourselves? in the 6 hrs of sleep we *might* of had?@ definitely report this dude.@ the duck pic is the best tho!@ this guy needs to stop bc its not working and its pathetic af.@ and the they have the audacity to get pissy when it takes forever to count the change bc their time is precious! when they literally couldve used a debit card, a gift card or even have their own bank convert the change into cash.@ as much as id like to make fun of her bc now she has to deal with her kid all summer but in the same breath that camp was probably jaxons only relief from his mom. poor kid.@ sea foam green@ sameeee. and they decided to start over and have another kid before high school so it was pretty much a teen pregnancy without getting pregnant.@ he does realize that his debit card would basically be the same as carrying cash right?@ those leggings/pants are cute tho! i wonder if theyre insulated or thicker than regular tights?@ when my okcupid account was up i had a 48yr guy all the the way in nd try and come at me saying he was gonna spoil me like a princess and then spank me like the cum slut i am in the first message.   i lived in fl and was 19. i asked him how tf was he going to do that when theres about 8-9 states between us and what exactly in my profile lead him to believe i was interested in any of that.   i never received a response.@ welp, then i read wrong.  my bad.  either way if she cant afford the rent they shouldnt move in together or find a cheaper place.@ thats not the issue fam. if you reread her post its her asking why she needs to pay *his* rent on top of the rent he wants her to pay for staying there for x amount of time. basically shes paying for both of them on top of the split for groceries and the extra gas she has to spend for the commute.@ if it was just her rent thats not fishy but when its paying his rent on top of hers when shes also covering groceries and gas for extra commute its suspect.  idk about you but one of my friends got roped into paying her last exs rent on top of hers +gas+groceries on a place he was renting to own for months and ended up trying to get her blamed for owing money on it despite her not being on the contract.  it was a shitty thing to do so ofc im gonna be critical when i see something similar happening to someone else. besides i already said pay *his* rent. ive got no qualms with her having her own rent.@ nta bc something smells fishy with bf needing you to pay his rent on something he equity in and if youre already out with groceries/commuting then now is not the time to move in until hes got his money in order.@ it sounds like he lied to get what he wanted and then hit it/quit it.  there are ppl out there like him and you were unfortunate enough to come into contact with one.   just know that this experience should not taint how you view yourself/worth bc he was a fool who missed out on what could have been the best person in his life.  this is just a very shitty experience that youre not gonna have again.@ a cafe or a mini shopping area@ god i fucking gate that. no ones prefect so wtf she thinks she has a right to come down hard on you?@ granted i need to lose some weight now but considering i was at 108lbs at 26 at my worst im not surprised how i yo-yo back.@ i am so sorry for what youre going thru.  my mom was never skinny as a teen so ofc shes gonna try and live thru me what she wanted in her life.  if you live with them now i hope you manage to get out bc honestly they sound toxic af and you deserve better.@ im glad at least some parents arent fucking mental like mine.  ppl like to say the asian stereotype of wanting their kids to be doctors is wrong but its what a lot of us have to suffer bc if its not a medical career they want us to be a professor or some business higher up instead of what they have a passion for.  i had a passion for art and they made damn sure to stomp it out to the point where i dont even draw for fun anymore bc whats the point?   i just wish the world at large would legitimately criticize parents like this instead of turning into a quirky tv trope for parents and showcase more healthy parent/kid relationships.@ what a bitch!@ listen, there is a fine line between teaching your kids the importance of being self reliant/goal oriented and beating it into your kid that they shouldnt have a social life bc mommy and daddy decided that youre in academic competition with the doctor and judges kids down the street and have you help finance for the 3rd kid they decided to have.   i wouldnt be posting here if my parents didnt fall under the extreme conditions of parents who whip their kid like a dead horse for classes they have no hope of passing bc its out of their limits but the doctors kids passed it so you have to prove youre a good asian and pass it, push them to pick up more hours despite being almost 15, still needing time for homework/sleep and part time and then call their kid selfish bc they want to go to their only friends birthday halloween party on saturday.  so maybe consider it sometimes *is* that deep.@ so shes like that bitch that killed her kids bc she thought they were zombies so she could live with her new hubby in hawaii.   tell her you forgive her and watch how fast her ass comes back to the states to get arrested for abandoning a minor.@ can relate.   my mom never had cramps so when i got them in the 3rd/4th grade i was at a loss bc my mom wasnt aware of them and shes an rn.@ so to escape the end of the world your parents abandon you guys and still believes she has the moral high ground? the bible is pretty strict on parents family loving/caring for each other no matter what so idk how she thinks shes a good christian or catholic (idk which she is but both run along the same river.)@ to be fair it was middle school so their ideas of relationships/sex were dumb af.@ i was about to comment that the only pussy he sees is in porn but he already confirmed it.@ that was the only saving grace but i made sure not to hang out with them as much as possible bc their idea of love was warped af.@ the closest ive heard of a woman making a rape joke that wasnt aimed at convicted pedophiles in prison was back in the early 2000s when yaoi/yuri was spreading in the us.  i love [male character a] but wouldnt it be so *hot* if he was raped by [male character b]?! the yaoiz xp  i am so glad that chapter in human history is over.@ im almost 30 and when i can get my apartment back i wont have to live with them but my baby brother and younger brother will have to deal with the shit storm after.  my mom already struggles with diagnosed depression and in the past expressed suicidal thoughts and my dad wont set foot in a couples counseling even if it meant saving the marriage bc men dont talk about their feelings  if anything i feel guilty knowing that if/when this goes down ill be able to escape and my younger brothers cant.@ nta.  you gotta let your mom know if she wants grandkids or for you to have a happy/fulfilling relationship with someone that isnt blood related  she needs to shut up and play nice.  ask your dad to remind your mom how it was when he was trying to introduce her to his parents so shell get some perspective and a side serving of shame.@ as a sagittarius i never have to worry about pants/shorts again but then again, how the fuck do i wear a swimsuit or drive a car?@ god i hope so. theyve been threatening this on/off since last year in august and its not fair that my baby brother is never gonna see what they were like when they were happy/stable.@ the problem is its 2 evils; the one that will hit you and verbal abuse you and then its the other that will only verbally and emotionally do the deed.  either way i really need the state to open up so i can get back to work and so i can move out again.@ hoping that i still retain what i currently know (and my current cellphone) give medical professionals the breakthroughs we currently have with treatment/care for cancers.  get my parents to invest in disney, apple and bath and body works. workout more and not care so much about what other kids think of me. enjoy what little time i had with my grandpa, aunt and babysitter (also get them to stop drinking and get them therapy.)@ hawaii, i heard that its beautiful and has a beach with black sand.@ and they wonder why im on my switch so often instead of answering texts/messages on social media.@ yup and unfortunately during the funimation/weeb boom of the early 2000s. not a fun time to be asian.@ our former next door neighbors kid graduated high school in 2019.   they do not have a backyard or front yard as big as my parents but have a 2 story house instead with a pool and jacuzzi.     they have a high fence around their property as do my parents. how do we know about the pool and jacuzzi?   for 2 weeks straight the neighbors let their kid have a party with their friend group that included but was not limited to;   partying until 4 am in the pool/jacuzzi   playing loud music with disagreeable lyrics   shining lights from what i assume was a disco ball or strobe lights   screeching at random times  fireworks that would escape their backyard and land in my parents yard (without anyone coming over to apologize even when one was enflamed on the roof)  joyriding the golf cart they had at odd hours in the night while blasting music  trying to dump their pizza boxes on our side of the fence and then denying that they did it  they attempted to egg our cars (but had terrible throwing arms) they stole the welcome mats from everyone on our street and then after we filed a report everyones may turned up at our doorstep   the screaming from the neighbors and their kids when they broke the fucking jacuzzi at 2:14 am   the breaking of glass bottles bc were free  and their dogs crying/barking bc of the noise@ immature af, shallow and preferred video games over me until he turned weeb then i became desirable after i broke up with him bc his logic was asian = submissive/kinky@ labyrinth@ it doesnt add up at all; either the masks are *majorly killing us* bc theyre so effective but in the same note they dont offer any protection from sneezing/coughing?  like what is the truth?@ these are the same parents that swear shoving garlic in their kids socks will cure them of the flu and bed wetting@ i wonder if ppl lost their shit when the no shirt, no shoes, no service was made into law or did they see the validity of *i dont want to see somebodys nipples or gross ass feet when im trying to eat at olive garden for my anniversary.*@ you want to be haunted by a strangers ghost? because that seems like a good way to be haunted by a strangers ghost.@ let me guess, $655 a month plus utilities and free wifi. no pets allowed, no indoor parking and the deposit is $500.@ im not gonna feel sorry for him when one of those women or b/gfs kick his ass.@ its called a glow up. more men could pull a glow up as well but most are too afraid to touch foundation or a highlight palette .@ do it! youre young and your hair will grow back!@ my condolences to his girlfriend and may she soon become his ex.@ guys like the one tweeting are the same ones that randomly message women/girls they dont know on fb or insta and dont have mutual friends in any capacity to shoot their shot.  then when theyre shut down bc *wtf are you i dont even know you* they lose their shit and post it all over snapchat and twitter.@ when they ask how old you are you have a 99.99% chance theyre trying to holler at you.  the other 00.01% are actual adults that dont want to have inappropriate conversations with a minor.   youre not in the wrong bc his walls of text definitely speaks volumes.@ and thats fine.  the world is a hot mess rn so anything goes. i only hope your parents can put things in perspective and understand not finishing college isnt the worst thing that can happen and just be glad they have you.@ op i promise youre not the asshole and your feelings concerning school not being beneficial for you is valid.  you shouldnt do something just bc your parents expect it from you and its your life, not theirs to live thru you.  everyone has their limits and there is no shame if at this point in time youve hit yours.  take the break you need for your health and so you can take time to heal.  if your parents are good ppl they should understand that this is your decision to make and respect that, offer you help and comfort. if not then at least know that youre not alone here.  college is not the end all route to success.   there are technical schools that are not only less money to attend but are faster and less messy than having to attend a 4 year university that requires you take 2 humanities classes, 1 language youll never use and a bunch of other classes that dont mix with your degree.   you are not a failure for not completing college its just not the right route for you. i just pray your parents are good ppl that will understand this and i will keep you in my thoughts/prayers.  nta@ pay attention to me or the chair gets it!@ it means your island is prefect and every week that it stays that way youll find another one!@ part 2

that theyre sharing their interests with me.  besides im pretty sure they do the same when i text/message them with things that i follow as well.@ from gifs it looks like a big karaoke party and a costume party had a baby.  looks fun.@ talk is cheap so what you do really has more worth.@ listen, when youre competing for leftovers in a house of 5 that includes 2 teenage bottomless pits that can and will demolish 23 slices of pizza in one sitting you learn to be grateful for what you can get!  and also ppl arent food so stop treating them like leftovers and be happy that you at least found someone that wants to be with you as much as you do with them.@ id show this to his new gf bc honestly if my b/gf was sending this shit to random ppl id break their fingers/delete pics/dump them.@ ive seen ppl who arent as groomed with b/gfs so if he really cant manage to get a gf then its probably his attitude keeping him single.@ look at those sweet beans@ well, heres to hoping its not a troll

theyre getting flipped out on and attacked by these crazed anti maskers, and theres no law (at least here in ohio) to back them up, only a mandate that fines the business. the business needs to figure out a way to enforce the standard and protect their employees.@ thanks! you too!@ its just me, my husband and our dog this year. i have a big family so we usually have 2-3 thanksgiving dinners spread out during the week on my side, and one on his. usually its really stressful for me to coordinate everything but this year im really missing everyone. weve seen our moms each 2x since march, and everyone else its been almost a year.   im lucky that i have my boys though. they got me through the virus and its complications since march. i realize that i have a lot to be thankful for, especially this year. i made a ginormous apple pie, and pecan pie so far. and homemade dog treats for the critter. well watch the parade (mostly out of curiosity on how theyre pulling this off in a pandemic?!), eat a good meal, maybe go for a hike, and zoom meeting with the families. itll be different but nice.@ totally agreed!@ im ok with wearing a mask for months. im in ohio, its cold here, keeps my face warm. but what ill take from this whole experience is we should normalize mask wearing when sick, in the future. at that point it wont be mandatory, but it shouldnt be something that others look down on.@ i dont blame them, i hope they get what they need. i wonder if this year will cause nursing shortages in the future. if i were a student i wouldnt want to go to nursing school after seeing the way nurses are treated~@ and the worst part is this applies to any future issues, too. if it doesnt pass now, well probably have a different, even crazier governor in two years thatll pass it then.@ id say use your best judgement, just be sure to wash everything. my favorite local grocery has a great rescue fruits/vegetables selection-ive found huge tubs of brussels sprouts or jalapeos for like $.99. im a big fan of the discount bins!@ i used to babysit this kid (lets call him a)with my boyfriend at the time. he was 3-4 years old and just a total sweetheart. well, my boyfriend and i broke up, it was my first breakup so it was kinda rough. months later we were at the same wedding, along with a and his family. i was bummed because it was probably 9 months after our breakup, and the ex had a new girlfriend. so a comes up to me, places a rose petal in my hand and goes heres a heart for you. my heart swelled 10x that day. sweet kiddo.@ i think id be ok as long as i have my husband. weve been isolating since about march and are handling it well. i keep busy with many hobbies and am constantly on a journey to make our lives the best they can be given the circumstances.@ case counts are part of the actual situation. its good to know, especially in the more rural parts of the state where more people still dont think coronavirus exists.@ yes, thats it. sorry-i updated the post.@ thanks-i updated above, my bad! i dont know why it didnt post before.@ youre not. when i had covid i had a lot of anxiety about everything. i quit awhile ago but my husband smoked up until our quarantine. he started using nicotine lozenges instead which you can just order from amazon or costco, so that might be a valid replacement for cigarettes if you cant get any.@ well get that all done this weekend. did you have any issues selling your house in a pandemic? thats the only thing im kinda nervous about.@ a lot of the stuff they sent me is not too far from you! or at least, like a fun 1/2 tank trip. its neohiofamilyfun on instagram. i think you can sign up on their website too.@ its called northeast ohio family fun, i found it through their instagram (same name). its really just specific to road trips within an hour or two of northeast/eastern ohio though. if youre not up here, id suggest checking in with your local tourism board. it never hurts to ask. or atlas obscura is a great website to use for local flavor.@ this is what i constantly have to remind my family. stay home. you dont need to go to target for cottage cheese (seriously, that happened). although i am bummed over cancelled holidays, i want to see my family alive and well next year.@ and be sure to socially distance, and limit in person shopping to essentials if possible.@ wait-really? im lucky my job extended wfh through next june so i guess im outta the loop. thats horrible though!@ obligatory not a doctor but when i was really bad i was on an inhaler (i forget which medication though), tessalon perles, and omeprazole because of gerd. those helped along with cough drops, ginger, bland diet, and delsym. the vitamins already mentioned in other comments above also helped, and tea.@ im wfh. i took two days off. im one of those people that, if im just laying around i start to doom spiral, so work helped take my mind off of things.@ i signed up for a local travel mailing list. they send me tons of freebies (apple pie gift certificate, two tickets to a local ferry, etc) and its fun getting mail with ideas of things to do that are pandemic safe.@ i mean, there are people who still care here, but the majority doesnt. most of my friends, family, my husband and i are still very careful. we just got tired of arguing with those idiots on social media.@ it is. i have so many friends in retail that are just exhausted from all the customers coming in trying to pick a fight about the mask mandate. even in places like cvs. hell i even had to remind a nurse to put her mask over her nose.@ true. which is why, and for many other reasons-i cant wait to get outta here.@ dewine needs to grow a backbone and take a stand instead of asking us to do whats right constantly. obviously people arent. we need actual consequences for the ones not wearing masks, not social distancing, large group gatherings, etc.@ https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/llama-antibody-engineered-block-coronavirus@ parks and rec, or the office.@ this is one of the reasons my husband and i want to move from ohio to vermont. even though we go above and beyond in taking every precaution, its everywhere here because our governor isnt doing anything, and most people in most rural communities are anti maskers, anti science. we wont move until theres a vaccine and if necessary well quarantine before.@ not excited about it at all since i have a doctors appointment@ i believe it. when i was actively sick i used pot lotion every night and that helped so much.@ not good, sundays usually have a lower count. i have a feeling this week is going to be a wild ride.@ im a former smoker who quit years before having covid. i had a horrible time with covid but that mightve been due to other circumstances. but my husband quit cigarettes during quarantining. he switched to the nicotine lozenges and has done awesome-i would highly recommend going that route if youre nervous about going cold turkey. and he smoked for 15 years, a pack a day.@ called three times so far. a car backed into a bicyclist. a horrible motorcycle wreck, and a coworker that tripped over an office chair, broke her shoulder and started seizing. first and third are ok, the second not so much.@ thank you i appreciate this info. were so ready to get out of ohio.@ whats the cost of living like versus living in vermont? my husband and i are looking to move out east, and what youve stated above are values we hold.@ thank you for posting these.@ thats horrible, im so sorry! i lost a friend to it, and had a horrible case myself.@ check out lakewood. pretty progressive, walkable city-the metro parks are nearby and 15 mins away from cleveland for baseball. we dont really have great skiing in ohio but your best bet is boston mills/brandywine@ theres no enforcement anywhere. if the government wont enforce a mask mandate, why make employees do it? theyre putting themselves in danger then, these anti maskers are crazy.@ from all the comments i see on dewines social media posts, they dont believe the pandemic is real. or if they do they dont think its that detrimental. its insane. ive given up trying to figure it out.@ it doesnt. im just pointing out that he did enact one.@ there is a mask mandate, theres just no enforcement.@ im also in a trump area and put up a sign that said knope/swanson 2020 and that set my neighbors off because they have no sense of humor. im sorry about your sign!@ ohioan here. it was ohio-but where he was is basically the florida of ohio (south bass island). even before the pandemic i avoided this place, it was fun back in the 90s but now its pretty horrible. they actively fought against disclosing employee cases in order to keep the bars/nightlife open.@ ohio here. where i live its very rural. lots of anti maskers. i even drove by a hair salon that said no masks allowed on the door. its just wild, the willful ignorance.@ i dont know, i know people who are able to tune it out and go on vacations every weekend, parties, restaurants, etc. its wild.@ this right here. i used to be a fighter but i mostly gave up. because lets be real, if they really cared the facts are out there. its more of a drain on my mental health to fight with these deniers. id rather just focus on keeping me and mine safe. its so exhausting.@ i have to force myself to stay away from comment sections because that thought process frustrates me so. people are so ignorant.@ nope, youre not the only one. im so nervous to get it again, whenever i get a random sore throat we get tested.@ me too. sucks doesnt it? ive already taken 6 tests.@ trump and family did not get tested before the debate because the arrived too late.@ good luck!@ delivery thru instacart, and once we both tested negative wed do contact free curbside pickup. i disinfect everything too.@ from what i understand there have been cases of reinfection so its possible you could have it again. id go get tested just to be safe. i hope you feel better soon!@ came here to find this. yes! long covid has definitely made my pms worse and my period was off for awhile. i had covid in march and the first few months before and after i had spotting which ive never had before, i tested for a lot of things and had negative results. thats basically stopped though. i do still get weird cramps on my sides/in my ribs which i never had before. and it caused me to have gerd and thats worse during pms. but my doctor stated that its normal for girls to pass out from pain from pms, which i think is totally wrong. i need a new doctor. but im glad im not alone in this.@ because a lot of places arent locking down but cases are rising, a lot of people feel that they need to personally lock down to take care of themselves/family. and theres really no national standard for that so it creates a lot of confusion across the land. in fact, at least where i live its seen as a negative thing because its viewed as a political statement. there have been attacks on people for wearing masks. also millions of people have lost jobs/income and were on the brink of a major housing crisis. its crazy.@ also lots of confederate flags along with that one and trump signs. and im in rural northeast ohio.@ interesting, i hadnt heard that yet but ill read up on it.@ that makes sense. its scary, other people need to get on board that climate change is our biggest threat.@ thank you for your reply. i agree, and my family is working on it. i know that the weight of this is caused by large corporations, but if this isnt the strongest case for decreasing our meat/dairy consumption i dont know what is~@ lately ive been interested in where the virus came from. i mean, yes-the bat. but how did the bat get it? is it possible that because of climate change, this is one of the viruses released by the melting of the polar ice caps?@ not to mention families that have lost multiple members, the grief must be unbearable.@ got sick. when i was no longer contagious (after 2+ weeks) but still feeling horrible my husband and i would spend hours playing uno, just to keep me distracted.@ red cross is offering free testing for antibodies with blood donation.@ youre absolutely right to feel that way. im in the same situation with many family members and i just dont talk to them anymore after running myself dry talking to them about the dangers of covid. it sounds like your dad is hurting and worried about his brother. its scary stuff even though your uncle is an idiot (to put it lightly). maybe come to him from the angle of caring about him and his feelings rather than your uncle.@ im wondering if people are confusing covid testing with the antibody test. ive taken 3 covid tests without paying anything (one in a hospital, one at rite aid, and one drive up) but i know it costs to get the antibody test unless you donate blood.@ its both. generally, 1/3 want him, 1/3 dont care, and the rest pretty much hate him. im in the third group. its not a democracy, otherwise wed have more say in the matter and not have our bills held hostage by mitch mcconnell. i wouldnt say were all qualified as idiots, just the majority are.@ well, they dont believe in it so theyre not taking any precautions to protect themselves (and others) from it. of course the media is going to write about this family, why wouldnt they? but there are plenty of written stories about people that have passed from covid while taking the correct precautions, too.@ i mean~ id hope theyd realize that was how many people had passed at that point. the website is being updated throughout the day.@ theyre quoting yesterdays data. the 2 is from today.@ its taken a toll on all of us. i havent seen my friends or family since feb. due to my husband and i quarantining since then. whats helped me is taking a break from the news, maybe checking every other day. reaching out to friends and family thru zoom. picking up a few hobbies and getting outside as much as possible. join the reddit gift exchange! its fun and you never know what youre going to get. and talking to a therapist has helped the most for me. i dont know, just throwing out some ideas to help you feel better.@ if i wasnt so sick i wouldve been drinking then too. her voice was so calming and steady. i feel so bad for her now.@ exactly! i miss dr. amy! she was the reason we were praised for taking bold steps first. and now hes undone all her work. he just gives cryptic statements about stuff he might do later on in the week, every week. cmon dewine, just shut it down already.@ im 33, had it back in march. my symptoms are all over the place. i could hike four miles one day and be fine for a week. then ill walk my dog a mile, get a familiar pain in my leg and be knocked out for four plus days with extreme fatigue, sore throat, fluid in ears, etc. thats my current situation. its very discouraging because i dont get much of a warning when itll happen, other than the leg cramp. ive also experienced gaslighting from doctors that im just too sensitive, which is not true at all.@ i always keep an extra mask (or two) on me for this reason. im putting my anxiety to work lol.@ i had covid-like symptoms in early march, but because of the limitations on testing i wasnt able to get a test at the time. i didnt have a fever, but i had mild symptoms of everything else. my husband had a fever for a day and a half but no other symptoms (and thats it, no lingering symptoms).   when my cough, chest tightness, fatigue, gerd, anxiety, shakiness, elevated allergies, suicidal ideation and inflammation lasted longer than 8 weeks i was told i had post viral syndrome and to treat it like it was a bad cold. thats it, no further info. ive never had any of these symptoms before so its been pretty scary. ive found a mix of meds that seem to work but i have more tests and appointments this week. and im signed up to donate blood and that comes with an antibody test so ill possibly know if it was covid. my doctor is 90% sure i did though.   thank you for posting this, this helps a lot with further questions that ill have for my doctor. and more stuff to send to my family who arent taking any of this seriously. its so stressful, i havent seen my mom and brother since feb because theyre not being careful.\n",
      "vlan de rien, mes deux derniers posts sont oc, il assume juste pas.@ 1) le mensonge comme seule dfense ?  2) quel que soit ce que je poste, a change pas le fait que ce format c'est de la grosse merde pour ceux qui savent pas faire de meme.@ personne :   les mecs qui savent pas faire de meme : `personne : `@ donc pas du tout comme tu l'as utilis ?@ and when i roll up on a motorcycle with my friend in front of a restaurant, people think we are gay. they don't watch the same videos you do.@ et alors ? tu as vu o exactement quelqu'un dire que la police ne devait faire de mal  personne ? nulle part. soit tu es compltement idiot et tu penses vraiment que tu dcris un cas dont on parle, soit tu es vraiment malhonnte pour faire comme si ce que tu dcris correspondait au sujet.  dans tous les cas aucun intrt de discuter avec toi.@ peu importe que ce soit le pape ou un mec qui jette des cocktails molotov, la police est l pour l'arrter, pas pour le punir. le tabasser reste illgal.@ puisqu'on parle des franais et pas des votes exprims, macron c'est 18% des inscrits, pas 24.@ if it's low elo, seraphine will have all the xp from creeps without taking the gold, thus being behind someone who's lower level but really farmed@ if i knew, i would be running the country@ where did i say that? try not to use sophism when discussing with others, they bring nothing of value.  no, the fact is that biden is the one rightfully elected. they are in fact two questions: what would be done so that election is peacefully recognized by everyone, and what should have been done to not be in this situation, and should be done by next election to not be in this situation again.  for the first point you have no choice, you have to convince the 73m unhappy people that the result is fair and square. propaganda is preventing that, anti propaganda laws have to be passed. a lot of work is expected there, because the american nationalism runs deep in the country, even among dems.  as for the second point, well there is even more work to do. american democracy is very broken. too much money involved, far from one person one vote, bipartisanship is killing you~ ditch this outdated constitution and start a new republic.@ that is for the dem side. so the dem voters trust that there is consequences if you commit crimes and try to undermine the democracy while you have the power.  but if you want your country to maintain a healthy democracy, you also have to work with the republican side. you have to convince them that those punishments are fair and deserved. you have to convince them that the elections were fair and by the rules. if you just ignore them, saying \"those are facts, i'm right and i don't care about what you think\", you will continue to divide your country. to be honest i don't know how to convince them, they are neck deep in the propaganda.@ as i said, the actual factual vote count does not really matters if enough people believe it was not obtained rightfully. it's not like the sunrise, where even if the whole humanity stop believing it will happen, will still happen. if a large majority think a vote was fraudulent and refuse to recognize the result, then the vote has no meaning.@ quite unpopular opinion, but in a democracy, the trust of the people in the elective system is of major importance. so, while facts do not care about feelings, those feelings still matter. if a large enough proportion of voters do not give their trust to the leader and to the elective system, then he has no legitimity.  hell, even in a dictatorship, if enough people say \"who is this guy anyway, just stop listening to him\", it is generally the end of this guy's reign. of course, when you control the army the proportion has to be way larger than in a functional democracy.@ in this thread, people who don't understand religion\n",

(upwork.com for software developers, soundbetter.com for musicians, etc.) simply bid on a project and then don't commit to delivering it more quickly than your health will allow. and~ the pandemic has caused companies to hire people to work from home - even in the case of jobs that traditionally required employees to work at the office! and i keep hearing that this shift to working remotely is likely to be permanent to a certain extent.  check this out:  (from indeed.com)  part-time dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) group leader psych, pllc - tennessee $100 an hour-part-time,contract-remote  psyche, pllc is a network of private practice therapists in multiple states. we are currently searching for a pre-licensed or licensed therapist in tennessee with experience leading a dbt group to run one or more of our online 1.5 hour long dbt groups for adults or adolescents. we provide the software, billing, and all administrative needs as well as a co-leader. -***please note *** -you must have prior experience using the dbt workbook by marsha linehan -you must have prior experience running dbt group job types: part-time, contract pay: $100.00 per hour medical specialty: \t\tpsychiatry covid-19 considerations: online sessions experience: \t\ttherapy: 1 year (required) license: \t\ttennessee (required) \t\ttennessee counselor or psychologist (required) application question: \t\tdo you have experience leading a dbt group? full time opportunity: \t\tyes work location: \t\tfully remote hours per week: \t\tless than 10 company's website: \t\tpsyche, pllc company's facebook page: \t\tpsyche, pllc@ > just because im paranoid doesnt mean they arent after me.  i can relate brother. once you get that schizophrenic label people can pretty much do anything to you that they want to do and there won't be any consequences.@ i never tell anyone that i have schizophrenia. (except for here where i am anonymous.)  also, i usually feel that i can tell the difference between the things that i believe that others would label delusional and the things that i believe that they wouldn't have a problem with. so i keep everything that they would label delusional a secret. this seems to have worked well for me. i do get hassled at times but really not very often. a good example is that i know for a fact that they have put electronics into my brain, but i know better than to tell anyone this!@ this probably won't help, but just consider the fact that there *are* a lot of haters out there. or are there lots and lots of people who treat you this way?@ move to canada! (i'm not kidding - they actually care about people up there!)@ i would suggest looking for some kind of alternative lifestyle. don't feel obligated to fit into the cookie cutters that society gives us. they just won't fit us. but there are other ways. maybe instead of asking how you can be successful in college you should ask how other schizophrenics have found a way to live, and perhaps how they support themselves.  good luck and keep us posted!@ done. good luck!@ i would like to participate, but not with my own voice. can i use text to speech software or else just send the text?@ since no one has mentioned it yet, i'd like to talk about \"flat affect\", which is a common symptom of schizophrenia. when i read up on this symptom, it is described as a reduction in the ***display*** of emotions. talking in a monotone, lack of facial expressions, not appearing to care about things normal people would have a big emotional reaction to. i emphasize the word ***display*** because what i read says that the emotions are present, they just aren't expressed. but i have vivid memories of flat affect, and i remember lacking both the expression of emotions as well as the emotions themselves.  later in life, i experienced the exact same things that you did - lack of romantic and sexual feelings - and though i have no way of knowing for sure, i feel strongly that both meds and schizophrenia were the cause of these symptoms.  the loss of romance and sex is a real tragedy, and i hope you will somehow find a way to solve this problem. good luck!@ things are changing for the better as far as the stigma thing goes, but i've learned the hard way that things just go a lot smoother if you just keep it to yourself.  but at least we love ya!!@ >things they thought were delusions about me were true  oh man can i ever relate to that! once you get that schizophrenic label they can pretty much do anything to you that they want, as long as it's something uncommon or unusual.   stay strong my friend!@ so sorry to hear about your terrible experience gazmerelda. want to hear my horror story?   i've been in a total of 7 mental hospitals - 5 for people with money, and 2 for poor people. my advice for you gazmerelda and for my other schizo brothers and sisters out there is pretty simple - never go to a mental hospital for poor people!!! both of my experiences were pure hell. the first was a state mental hospital. know what they did to us to cure our schizophrenia there? for almost all of every day we were confined to a small room with a blaring television on the wall. and the tv program that was played all day long every day? the jerry springer show! we got to hear lots and lots of bleeps and all about guys screwing their sisters and things like that. but the most amazing thing of all gazmerelda was that it cured my schizophrenia! yesiree i got so well that i got out of there and never went back again! lots of times there i couldn't stand to be in that little room with the tv so i would go lay down and try to sleep in the hall on the cold linoleum floor. nobody ever even offered me a blanket or anything.  the second poor people mental hospital i was at was in the downtown of a big city. my \"treatment\" consisted of a psychiatrist treating me like i was on trial for murder. the only thing he ever did for me was to grill me like a prosecutor with the objective of proving that i was faking my symptoms and didn't have a right to be there! (as this story unfolds you are going to see how absolutely laughable it was to think that anybody would fake anything to get into this hellhole!) the whole time i was there i was terrified that i was going to be killed in retaliation for telling the doctors about the people who persecuted me. i begged for an anxiety pill. know what they gave me? an antihistamine pill! i survived the weekend but when monday came i found out that on weekdays we had to go to classes for most of the day. you should have seen those classes! you'd think you had just walked straight into hell! i still remember what it looked like looking over the crowd. one older black woman had her hands up in the air crying and moaning like she was going thru withdrawal or something, and many of the rest of the patients were in a similar condition. the classes turned out to not be about learning at all~ it was just a place to herd us cattle into.  sorry for such a long post. i'm like you - it feels good to get this off my chest.  thank y'all for listening and stay safe and happy my brothers and sisters!@ wow! what a great music video! i've never seen anything like this before!@ thanks so much for your wisdom blue-mage!! ill check it out!@ thanks for the advice 2muchlife!@ i think it's wonderful that you care worrytoomuchhh. that's a really big thing right there. as for changing his mind about reality, i don't want to be discouraging, but i can only say that when i am delusional there's no way anyone is going to be able to make me question or doubt my version of reality, not even just a little bit. but this can actually take a lot of weight off of your shoulders, since it means that you really don't need to feel like it's your duty to change his beliefs. instead, maybe you could just be his sister/friend? in any case, i can tell you for sure that being loved never hurt me a bit, and i bet the same applies to your brother.  i wish you the best in your challenging journey!  dagan@ almost forgot~ i'm a lifelong atheist and i am not a person to ever even begin to believe in god. the only times i have ever prayed or acted like i believe in god were the times when i was scared out of my mind because of schizophrenia.@ i don't remember writing it at all. it's just something i found on my laptop. however, notice that it has a lot of language like this:  \"tonight i have a lot of fear. i feel alone, and i don't know what to do.\"  knowing myself, i'd say there is a 99.9% chance i was schizophrenic when i wrote that. and then there's the flip side of that coin - i can't even begin to imagine that i would write something like that when i was \"normal\".  thanks for your comment. any chance you would share something you wrote in a psychotic state? no pressure - only if you want to.\n",

normal and you will be ok.   it just is incredibly hard. you will need time and space to grieve. recognize that you are facing a huge loss--the loss of the future you thought would happen and the role of someone important to you in your life. it will take time to even imagine that you will be ok again. but one day at a time, you will! there is someone who is waiting for you to spend more time with them and get to know them deeply and take better care of them right now, and it's your own self. please listen to them and nurture them.   you are not alone! keep talking to your friends, trusted elders, post online if you need to, read books or blogs about breakups and grief. journaling or writing letters you won't send can also help. you will be ok. there is unimaginable joy waiting in the future for you.   sincerely, a 26 year old who was devastated by their first breakup at 21, like throwing up and nauseous for a week, and who needed lots of time and space to heal, but who found so much peace and joy and things to learn about love as they grieved and healed and eventually thrived!@ if it were me i would. that's because i believe any good relationship, platonic or romantic, is built on honesty. there is no point if i and my friends/lovers are not being open with each other.  whatever happens going forward i think you also need to be honest with yourself and her about the fact that your friendship to date has some unhealthy elements. it's not normal or ok for a close friend to suddenly ignore you for weeks without telling you why, it's not ok for her to take your phone and delete your messages with someone else--these would be red flags for abuse if you continued an intimate relationship with her.   so if it were me i would want to confess, but i would also be ready to lay down firm boundaries, or pack up and move on to healthier friendships and potential romantic relationships.@ no problem. it is also ok not to know. no matter what you choose, and what the outcome is, you will always have the power to make another choice. in such a difficult situation, theres so much you cant controlkeep focusing on yourself and what you can control.@ it sounds like a very difficult situation. ultimately, it comes down to what you think is best. no one else can tell you what is right or wrong for you to do with your own hair.   i want to make a strong statement that as a human being, you have every right to express yourself and explore how you want to wear your hair. it is sad so many people around you are misguided and have forgotten the importance of that.@ its really hard. the thing is, most places you go, you will continue to face this situation. america has many homogenous communities (majority white areas, majority black areas~). i have been struggling with this too, but realized that i will always be in this situation. even if i were magically able to be in a place with lots of asians, i would still probably be different because they could be from a different country, a different generation, gender identity etc. (i am non-binary and a lot of older east asian immigrants dont understand or accept that.) knowing that our circumstances wont change, we need to look within us to see what we can actually control about ourselves and our choices. i put energy into and draw support from meaningful relationships that help me be who i am. i find work that lets me develop my sense of purpose and ability. i keep learning about myself and the people around me. you should also do what feels right for you. youll find a way through.@ thank you!@ this is gold. thank you for the level of detail and thought! i will be looking into these.@ im subletting a studio in downtown (near main and old south sts) that is 595 a month, plus 30 for electric and 40 for wifi. its pretty small and maybe shitty by some peoples standards (old carpet, the floor in the kitchen is uneven, etc), but totally functional, safe, and works for me. so it is possible but depends on your standards. i also dont know if there are other places like this one, if theyd be available. i found this sublet on craigslist. the commenter above seems like a good lead too. good luck.@ i think that with ancestry, so much is possible. it depends on your specific familys history and when they became taiwanese. if they were part of the more recent groups of han chinese fleeing the mainland for taiwan, its less likely. if your family has been in taiwan for a long time, its possible you could have indigenous taiwanese ancestry. those nations are part of the polynesian chain, language and ancestry wise.@ i would feel terrible too. it is worth speaking up if you felt uncomfortable. your response is valid.@ ok, thank you.@ i agree with people who have said better to avoid it. there is always likely a more specific term you can use instead (you provided many examples in your post).   the origin of the word is because orient means east. east of what? britain, of course. so the people who invented the term and popularized it were using it from a place of lumping together all the differences they were encountering while colonizing that part of the world and other-izing these differences in relation to themselves, westerners, as normal.   even when the word is used for objects, it sounds inauthentic to me. i associate it with white people slapping a broad label on anything they think is different. i also associate it with companies trying to make things look exotic in order to sell them, which is gross.@ theres no one way to be japanese. someone could be the kid of two japanese parents but raised in canada, and not speak the language at all, and also feel the same as youdisconnected or that somehow theyre falling short of the culture theyre supposed to have. no matter what, you can always find a reason to think you arent enough.   dont think of it as a loss of culture or that you are falling short. think instead of all the things you have gained due to your unique heritage.   to learn more, because you are not the first to feel this way, i recommend looking up and reading books or other media about japanese canadians or japanese americans, including fiction and memoirs. you may learn from their stories.@ a good test for when youre not sure if a behavior is ok is to ask yourself:  would it be ok if my friend did this to me? would it be ok if my coworker or boss did this to me? would it be ok for a random stranger to do this to me?  this is totally inappropriate behavior that violates your boundaries. you may have trouble seeing that for a while because this man has been violating them for so long you are used to it. keep asking yourself these questions and trying to learn more about appropriate and inappropriate behaviors.@ i got a $3 coupon with my new meluna cup, pm and ill be happy to share the code with a fellow new cup buyer!@ its hard. youre not alone. i am non-binary and my family currently provides no support or even the minimum amount of respect for my gender expression. i moved out recently though and having more space from them is really good for me. i hope you can find the same.@ yes. and it cant be a conversation as long as one person is not able to engage with what the other person is trying to say. you can love them but you cant change them, and you shouldnt keep doing the same thing hoping they will magically change when they wont. because your energy is better invested in other places.@ you are so welcome. the fact that its hard for you will make it more amazing when you have done it. make sure to celebrate your growth afterwards.@ who wouldnt be bitter? at least now you know. use that knowledge you gained to make decisions that protect your happiness in the future.@ blanket statements like that are usually not true. do you really believe that?@ i can relate to not being used to talking about sex. you just need practice. it will get easier and strengthen your relationship and sex life if you are able to communicate openly about it.   take some time before you talk to him to figure out what you want him to know and anything you may want to know that youd like to ask him. you can make a bullet list, if writing helps you think, or talk about it with a close friend first.   then when you have a moment alone with him just say, i want to talk about having sex. and go from there. you can do it.@ to explain further, he doesnt deserve an explanation or a chance to make his case for why you should stay. his abusive behavior is enough of a reason for you to leave and you dont owe him anything. maybe you should trust that instinct you have thats telling you its just going to be terrible so why do it?@ do you have to tell him? can you just go?@ you said it perfectly. do not sacrifice your own happiness for theirs.   move in with your boyfriend if that is what you want. they may be controlling but you dont have to let them control you anymore once you have established your own ways to support yourself.   a basic boundary for behavior would be that it is not acceptable for them to tell you to break up with your boyfriend because of his race. any time they do that, i would just say so and leave the conversation. if they dont react well to that kind of thing, you can do it less directly but still just make an excuse and exit the conversation. you do not have to sit there and entertain their ridiculous notions. its not fair to you or your boyfriend.   additionally, if your parents are as racist as they sound, why would you even want to introduce him to them? it sounds like it would be awful for him. keep putting yourself and him and your relationship as your priorities.@ your dad demonstrated he cant be reasoned with. i wouldnt even try. if its safe to do so just keep dating who you want to date and limit conversations with parents about it until they can be reasonable.@ its a refreshing read and formatted differently than most self help books! i hope you enjoy.@ the courage to be disliked codependency for dummies@ i agree with you. my point is that this does not need to be pointed out to op, as its likely that he is harder on himself / less willing to see his own trauma as valid because of this.   its similar to how underage boys who commit sexual assault are immature and still developing, or unfortunately caught in a very twisted stage of development. however, it would still be cruel and unnecessary to say to a survivor, it doesnt make it ok but those boys who traumatized you were also young and immature.   it causes pain and is simply not the point.@   these girls who hurt you in high school were children. as a doctor you well know how long it takes for the human brain to fully develop. it doesnt make what they did ok - thats on their parents! - but a lot of learning and life can happen between childhood and adulthood.  if it doesnt make what they did ok, dont bring it up. even though it may not be your intention, it diminishes what happened to op and the trauma he experienced at those peoples hands.   i think lots of women have heard similar comments that downplay their experiences of abuse or sexual assault. when those toxic ideas get internalized by a person with trauma, they will continue to use them to beat themselves up, like why am i still so upset about something that happened with i was a kid and they were kids? something must be wrong with me and my reaction to the situation.@ agreed.\n",

traditional means. thats why id have no reservations to actually go after him. id rather be the asshole than keep still knowing i did not do everything i could to be sure my best friend is safe.@ i know the most obvious answer should be leave him alone, if going by the fact that he left without telling us, as if he had already spoken by his actions.  the issue is that he didnt leave in a sound

will understand. the ones who know theyre just as helpless as you feel about it sometimes are the ones who become the best companions, and then friends.  reach out to people, let yourself be fine when youre fine and let yourself be down when youre down. if its anything like my case, what youre going through is grief. grief about the sense of security in your own body and life in general. about your relationships and activities. let yourself be not-fine, but dont stop giving yourself choices. get your own power back, even if you feel like youve lost control of a lot in your life.  be there for

my old family doctor and seeing if he can give me the prescription and ill just look for a non medical therapist on my end.@ its not the us, surprisingly, lol.  i actually have decent private insurance, save for no mental health coverage (which no one really offers). and social security around here is not bad in itself, but public mental health programs are really hard to get into (maybe a year plus to maybe get to see a psychiatrist again, or missing work 1 a week to get in line at 6 am to maybe get an appointment that day). those are the national ones; im looking into more local programs, but many smaller clinics are still closed down bc of the pandemic and not receiving new cases.  initially, i did negotiate frequency of appointments with my doctor, but with so many treatment changes and studies i had a really hard time keeping up with myself and getting timely feedback from her. i also have a therapist friend looking for someone willing to treat me for cheap, but havent found anyone yet.  i actually considered filing for disability to get the treatment aid checks, but thatd prevent me from working or studying full time for the rest of my life and at least my insurance and salary adjust for inflation.  its a mess, but im not exactly giving up yet. im hoping perhaps once i rid myself of the constant anxiety over my finances and the number it was doing on me ill take better, less desperate treatment decisions. maybe i was just too exited to have something work for me at the beginning /:@ firefox + ublock origin. making reader mode be the default mode to load websites also works, but its not exactly fighting back. if you really wanna do that, stop visiting the site.  whats awful is that i work as an analyst and, unfortunately, these things do work

caffeine does the same to me and, honestly? what has worked the best for waking up is cold water. just~ gulp that bitch in the morning and get that vagus nerve going.  seriously, though. thats what i

few months ago: traumatic childhood and a screaming roommate. doors also bang in our apartment pretty easily and thats a whole issue in itself.  what i recommend is talking to him about this and asking if you can be present while he plays, if you can handle it. maybe seeing him yell at the game and knowing its not for something bad or that youre not in danger can help you break those associations. thats what worked for me, at least. i still get scared or jumpy, and im almost ten years older than you, but it stopped being terrifying as time went on.@ yeah, i know.  and were made famous through that whole just tastes better thing. it even said so in the link i posted first.  for the local market, or, you know, actual mexican coke that is not just called that for the niche market that surged around it, they only sell the new artificially sweetened formula to avoid heavy taxes, even the glass bottled one they sell here.@ ive had it work for phone calls, but for media, also across iphone and ipad.@ not anymore, unfortunately. .  also, to dance around regulations regarding taxation of energetically dense food and drinks in mexico, they also started adding sucralose (splenda) to reduce caloric intake.  the one they sell in the us as mexican coke does use real sugar, though, but its made specifically for the us market. its as mexican as taco bell.@ i mean, if you had actually read what i linked, youd know that there already are late wooden structures in place, just not in the us.  and, if you knew how pr and marketing works, youd also know that, for example, with the gas stoves, of course the single family home market isnt their biggest business share, but keeping consumers interested in the product through the intimacy that implies posing it as safe to use at home and better than the alternative, contributes to build public trust when it comes to getting support or lessening public resistance when it comes to larger developments by the same companies.  though i admit im letting myself be conspiracionist about the issue.@ induction stoves are not the same as the ones that just heat up a coil. they use an electromagnet to generate a magnetic field which heats up magnetic metals within that field, which is why aluminium pans wont work with them but cast iron and stainless steel do.  it is the most efficient way to transfer heat in the kitchen, and, since you can control the power of the magnet very precisely, you can also control the temperature to a more precise degree. with the coil ones you rely too much on its heating inertia, so temperatures change slower than with gas or induction.@ yeah, the conversations a bit too buzzword-y to really understand all the implications of using wood, and the guy being interviewed in the article dodgers the question of how exactly wood is being made fire safe enough to compare to steel and concrete.  to answer your question, since wood is lighter, it can be taller without having to support as much weight as concrete or steel. and being more flexible than both means weight can distribute better across the entire structure.  to clarify, though, im not advocating for wood buildings in any way. we have enough illegal wood trade as it is, at least where im from. but i started learning about this because i got into a rabbit hole of alternative building materials because were apparently running out of sand, which is a fundamental component of concrete, along with cement and gravel, so architects and developers have been really scraping the bottom of the barrel for new materials, lest we slow down urban development in the (macroeconomically speaking) near future.@ definitely, but the architects and engineers behind this push for tall wood structures .@ at this point, im convinced this is just a move by a cement lobbys pr firm trying to up sales after they forecasted a decline in concrete use for buildings ().  kinda like how even when induction cooktops are more energy efficient.@ you can tell theyre masc because they cant dance.@ its from an  over text messages.@ i actually love just how many words for tenses there are in spanish, like, just hit me up

lose the ability to enjoy it, slowly filling you with dread upon the realisation that the world moves along without you.@ ill have to start a reading list with very different things. its been so long since i actually read something for fun that i dont know what i like anymore, lol.@ i think this is what ill end up doing. just building towards more complex things. just like exercise, i guess.@ we actually had , but orgs and activists claimed corporations had too much legal wiggle room to play with portion sizes to display lower numbers on the label, so it was decided it was better this way, . theyre actually banning brand mascots for food as well.@ i was going to criticise the column, but is a column still a column if its not providing structural support?@ suburb but like suh-burb, with a very short u sound, not with the american short u bc my mother tongue is a bitch.@ a lot of my friends agree that when youre gay and lived closeted (particularly from yourself) for a long time, you live your teens in your twenties.  i feel like thats true here. i had a boyfriend like that and i put up with far too much toxic stuff from him because i was genuinely relieved that a man could be interested in me after i had gone through.  believe me when i say you deserve better. you deserve not to settle and you deserve to continue to grow and build the person you want to be after overcoming what you went through. youre already doing the work in getting better, he isnt and hes holding you back because you are his comfort zone. dont let him. leave and heal.  if youre gonna be with someone, hes gotta be someone who can help you grow in the ways you want to grow.@ no worries. i *hate* condescending bosses. ive actually quit a few jobs because of people like that. like, i know what im capable of, but i also know the kind of support i need to be capable of that.  in that case i might emphasise my exercise suggestion. i use resistance bands and they are cheap and work great without needing much space. or any other activity that can help you focus with yourself in a monotonous yet engaging way, like drawing or baking. i know im having a rough week the next one and already have a couple of recipes i want to try out, haha.  keeping an activity that can be rewarding to yourself can take off a bit of the weight of the constant need of outside approval. its honestly the best. knowing you did well because you feel well, not because someone else told you so.@ are you getting treatment? if not, then thats something you might want to look into. for some of us, its night and day and is definitely worth it.  and, i know it will sound like a clich but, regardless of if youre not able to get medical treatment for adhd or not, i strongly recommend exercise (resistance training in particular) and meditation (declutter has been my favourite app for this).  both are activities that boost the reward system in the brain and help you train to remain focused on single tasks. theyll be hard at first, but all lifestyle changes are hard for us anyways, and this ones worth it.  as for work, dont be afraid to ask. its a million times better (for both your mental health and for your performance) that you ask when you dont know how to do something than having to having to request someone to cover for your mistakes each time. if you trust them, explain your condition so that they can help you be more patient with yourself.@ this is great because , and maybe now we know why.@ what do you mean you dont have a co2 tank around your house to bully your stale espresso into having crema again through aggressive re-gasification?@ thank you for this. i left him a note letting him know that im angry and will distance myself for a while. hopefully, ill get over it, but im really upset right now and focusing on not thinking about how to get back to him.@ it went off three times during the night and i called them each time. they arrived exactly 0 of those times.@ this is a not-terrible idea. the first part, at least. theres nothing in the store thats more worth to me than being able to be in my bedroom in silence.@ lol, no worries. i actually started looking for companies that could print fliers to leave in the mailboxes of the two-three neighbouring builds around here.  if i end up going for the ladder and the foam, at least that would make it more difficult to look for me specifically if somebody notices someone messed with the alarm.@ i guess i can try putting fliers everywhere asking for more people to report it and calling the store. that sounds outstandingly ethical, though.  id love not to rely on the will to cooperate of others.@ im leaning strongly towards using expanding foam, but i still need to get up there. i *have access* to a ladder (a neighbour stores theirs in the garage), but have no one else to hold it while im up there. is there a safe way to set it up by myself?@ the foam is actually a solid idea, but i have no one to hold the ladder for me.@ no, it is because i want to destroy the alarm.@ i was kind of intrigued by this and then saw it was yet another coffee smart gadget thats been made so much more complicated for not being allowed to work on its own.@ im gonna go out on a limb here and suggest you get therapy. i was having trouble with treatment adherence for another thing (bc of denial, basically), and a friend recommended me cognitive behavioural therapy. i talked about my eczema as well, and its been kind of great to start seeing it as something i can actually manage, given the right tools.  having eczema can be very mentally and emotionally taxing. you shouldnt have to go through it alone.@ this is like those satisfying woodworking videos dark, unstable cousin.@ that might also have to do with the different schedules you guys have, because, by the time youre trying to wind down and need alone time, shes probably had time for herself and craves affection. discussing how you can work together so that the approximate times youre both open for affection can align during the day or along the week can be important.@ ill get to trimming then, just need a good pair of shears. hopefully one of the cuttings can grow roots as well. thanks!@ ugh~ that app seems cool. id honestly download it in a heartbeat, but im a bit privy when it comes to privacy, lol.  i believe a lot of what makes it hard (for me, at least) about remembering details of people is that i lack the physical reference to associate that information with them.   what i did back in my university days was keeping a moleskine journal with a page or two dedicated to people id met relatively frequently and divided the journal by setting: classes, extracurriculars, work, the coffee shops~  then i got a bit more abstract and assigned each one a very specific colour based on how i felt around them, and then marked their pages with that same very specific colour (from my designer sisters infinite copic marker stash) and that gave me the more sensory side of remembering people i was missing.  i dont keep a journal anymore, but i still do the colour thing in my mind, and it kind of works well most of the time.@ royalty soaps made , from how to measure supplies, beginners equipment, and general safety recommendations. theyre the last videos on that playlist.  i have to admit i havent mingled with soap in a while, so the best tips i can give you are: get a scale, an immersion blender, a silicon spatula, and try to reuse things you might have at home for the rest of the equipment (mostly containers). once you get more serious, you can decide which things to get based on which aspect of your process youd like to streamline the most.  admittedly, these are for cold process soap, the whole saponification deal. if you want melt and pour, you basically only need eye and skin protection, the soap, and some molds + some fragrances and colourants to costumise your final product.@ awww, its going great! did you do anything to help it grow longer? i got one as a gift a couple of months ago and it keeps getting fuller on top, but hasnt cascaded yet ):@ this went full classic twilight zone.@ i think that the best tip is could give you is to stop pressuring yourself to be good on your first run. bayonetta is a fun game that allows for a lot of creative play styles, but that comes with practice.  play through it once, turning back as little as possible and enjoy the ride. practice dodge offset (dodging without releasing the attack buttons so you dont interrupt combos) and memorise two or three long combos and let the action of the game guide you through playing.  on your second and third runs of the levels you want to repeat, try to get lots of halos and buy cool accessories that match your play style and get flashy with your combos on lower level enemies. theres no satisfaction like getting pure platinum on battles that were hard before, really.@ its basically the theoretical vs. applied science approach to solutions.  science is cool when you want to know why things work the way they do but, when you need to apply them, you just have to accept they work and use them.  kats thinking like a scientist when she needs to be approaching this more like an engineer.@ i like that they referenced coyote bc its something i had been thinking about.  time travel might not necessarily create a bootstrap paradox, like many of us were thinking, if its done through the ether.  i mean, logically, it is a contradiction that coyote can be both dead and alive at the same time, like when he was talking to loup but, etherically, its just a thing thats possible, consistent with its own rules without breaking the universe in half.@ im telling you this as a queer person raised by homophobic parents: save all the money you can and stop sharing your personal life. get out of there as soon as possible.  in the meantime, what worked for me was finding two or three innocuous topics of conversation to talk about so that she doesnt lash out because of silent treatment or suspect deep resentment, otherwise, she might try to punish you again and make it easier for you to leave.  my relationship with my parents did eventually improve (took the better part of a decade) after they decided they preferred to let go of their beliefs than letting go of me. some of the people in my family chose the first one and im no longer in touch with them.  it *can* get better, but for that to happen you need to do anything you can to keep your sanity without falling into destructive habits that might be harder to overcome in the long run than getting out of your house.  try to get help for dealing with your assault and her abuse. there are some support groups guided by therapists that are relatively cheap compared to traditional therapy (because of the whole group thing) and can be easier to attend because a lot of them moved online. hotlines for lgbt+ support should be able to provide information on resources close and accessible to you. i emailed it gets better a while back and they gave me some information about resources that genuinely saved my life and mental wellbeing at some point, though i did have to reach out and look around for the one that was right for me.@ wow, i didnt know they made those. theyre a bit pricey over here, but ill definitely give them a try on the next pay check. thanks!@ should i store them in a container or a bag or are they good just like that?@ that seems to be the general consensus, so ill give it a try. i used to love keeping plants.  do all herbs survive well in similar conditions? like sunlight, temperature and ventilation? im just trying to figure out if i could keep them all in one place or id need to find different places around the house for them.@ i just tried the jar for my herbs this week and the stems rotted in less than a week ): i tried to change the water every day but i missed two consecutive ones and they were gone. i guess ill follow the general recommendation and try to grow them myself.  ill also bag the carrots next time. are they still good for cooking if theyve gone soft? like for a stock or stew?@ thank you! this is just what i was looking for. my carrots went soft in the crisper, unfortunately, but i also didnt think of bagging them first. my mother used to hate plastic bags and taking them out is a habit i retained.  as for the herbs, i havent gotten much success with keeping them alive, but theres a flower market near my apartment where i can get them already potted and grown, and instructions for proper care, so ill give it a go.@ im definitely gonna try filling the containers with water, i hadnt thought of that. thanks!@ that meme from a few months back about repairing everything with ramen noodles.@ i left my doctors office yesterday without paying her and remembered only after i went to buy coffee to wait for the rain to pass (uber is more expensive when its raining) and being puzzled by why i was carrying so much cash.  in my defence, she forgot as well.@ these look gorgeous, but i have to admit that being into both soap making and baking has permanently fucked up my brain.@ i just got my third replacement in three months yesterday. lmao.@ it is, and high salt intake leads to elevated blood pressure, which can alleviate this particular issue (but lead to many others if you also have high cholesterol).@ it can be salt. salt leads to the kidneys not discarding water, which leads to a higher water retention in the body and increasing blood pressure

      "honestly, somehow it's not the anti-maksers who anger me the most because at this point i know not to expect compliance from them. it's the people who have been taking masks seriously but are now going, \"but~.i'm going to get on a plane and see my family for the holidays. i should be fine~.\" i get that people are getting lockdown fatigue. but good lord. when people say \"i'm okay with taking this risk.\" it's not a risk you're taking for yourself. you're taking that risk for others who could be infected because of you. not social distancing is basically like drunk driving.@ honestly, it's so frustrating when they say \"well your scans look fine~\" like, i don't want someone to pity me, but it feels like they're saying, \"yeah, you get crippling pain, nausea, major confusion, etc. etc~..but there's nothing growing there so~..you're lucky!!\"@ that would almost explain mine, but, literally, if it's after midnight, i can do all the things laying down and no migraine. it's really crazy though how bizarre triggers can be. i do wonder if it's possible mine could be from blood pressure perhaps? my sleep cycle is naturally delayed (2 am to 10 am) so~maybe the blood pressure change that happens when laying down is only \"migraine safe\" when there's a certain chemical balance in my brain??? aaaaaaaa migraine are soooo weird~.@ yeah i've been able to lay in bed for 2 full hours post midnight to watch a movie. never gives me a migraine! i can also lay in bed unable to sleep for an entire night and not get a migraine. which is why i'm so puzzled by it. i don't understand why the time of day should matter to my brain ahaa@ the way your top theory list just goes on and on is suchhhhhh a mood. at this point i have no idea what's up. thanks so much for letting me know that i should get in touch with my neuro. had no idea the more the happen the more intense they will get. realllllllly wish my neuro told me this stuff~.good luck with yours!@ hmmmm, i'll definitely consider it then. i will say that just from brushing and flossing + saltwater rinses over the past couple days, the bleeding has decreased substantially. so, i think i'll give it about a week to see if good habits clear it up, and, if not, i'll go in. thanks for the insight.@ on a second thought, looking it up, i~may consider an appointment? i'm still uncertain, but maybe if my gums aren't any better in a week or so from now, i might~@ yes, we do, but according to the cdc, only emergency dental procedures should be done right now. something to do with virus particles hanging in the air, and, of course, a dental hygenist who could be asymptomatic.@ \"but your tests look fine.\" /s     i've been lucky to not get alice in wonderland syndrome but boyyyyy does it sound wild.@ for a while, i was using rizatriptan, but it has become less effective within the past few months. fortunately, if i avoid screens and walk around, i can usually get the migraine to go away. i've had a lot of different types of migraines over the years. awful ocular ones~horrible ones if i didn't get enough sleep, hormonal ones. now it's some kind of neck pain/light/posture/something migraine.@ honestly, maybe this is just a me thing, but it sometimes annoys me how severe the effects of migraine can be and doctors just go \"yeah nothing is actually 'wrong' with you, just~.i dunno~.get enough sleep at night?\" it feels like my own body is gaslighting me. it's not like i want something to be wrong with me, but feeling like some mysterious enigma wears me down sometimes.@ thanks so much for sharing your experience. praying was a big one for me too, and the issue actually became a driving force behind me becoming agnostic among other reasons. i think the unsettling part is that the \"someone\" that my brain says will attack me is often a horror monster. \"what if i look out the window and all of a sudden a face is staring back at me.\" but hey, if i ever want to write a horror story, guess i'll have plent of inspiration. thanks for the reassurance that i'm not going crazy. i'm just trying to tell myself that the thoughts are getting intense because i've been struggling with quarantine.@ seriously. the least people can do is behave safely for 4-5 months so people don't needlessly die~.@ i'm talking about the people who aren't wearing masks and are throwing birthday parties, house parties, demanding for sports to be started again, and claiming it's all excusable because \"but not having a normal birthday party is so sad!!!\" yes, it sucks. but these people are risking the lives and safety and others for just some party. and when they excuse it with \"but being isolated is so hard,\" it drives me up the friggen' wall. another part of it that gets to me is people are trying to use it as an excuse yet this is the same society who stereotypes homeschoolers as weirdos and says they're lying or exaggerating when we tell them how isolating it is.@ yeah, i'm not saying people shouldn't be upset about being locked in. i'm saying that breaking protocol and then excusing it on \"oh it's so hard being locked in!! i'm missing out on so much!!\" is such a crappy excuse, especially from the perspective of someone who was isolated for well over a decade.@ yupppp that's what i'm worried about. if i hate the short hair, waiting for it to get as long as it is now will be one longggggggg awful transition haha. thanks for letting me know about the buzzcut option though!@ thanks for the thorough answer! yeah, i'm thinking now, if i cut it short, i'll try cutting it considerably short with some parts having a fade to avoid neck touching. also, highfive for the hair sensory sleeping thing. didn't think i'd find another person who struggled with it. i tend to not do the pony tail/bun with mine, since if the scrunchie starts pulling the wrong way when i sleep i absolutely hate it. but glad to hear that method works for you!@ thank you so much for the advice! hm, i might end up waiting a bit longer to get my haircut. i think i'd really like to have the sort of \"fade\" on my neck like you were saying, but my parents are pretty rigid on only \"traditional girl\" hair cuts. and yeah~i could just go and try a more traditional \"girl\" cut, but man, if it causes sensory issues, i'll have to wait a whileeeeee for it to grow out of it.@ exactly. like, trust us, missing one prom or birthday party isn't going to misalign your life with the cosmic rotation of things and forever set you on a trajectory for permanent disaster.@ thanks so much for the detailed answer! i'm just planning to go for a simple short, cut. no shaving or anything like that. so, my only concern is the hair ends touching the top of my neck/base of my skull. especially since my hair is coarser.      and that's a good point about having a plan. yeah, maybe a headband could work? either way, you just made me realize i should probably wait until the holiday break to do this so, if it does cause big problems, i won't have that many other responsibilities to manage like school and such.@ ahhh, thanks for letting me know! fortunately, i think any place will take my hair since i've never dyed it (want to one day~one day). i'm excited to donate my hair since i have quite thick, curly hair, which can be a bit harder to match for a kid with that type who lost theirs. so, i'm looking forward to contributing it.@ thanks for the insight!@ okay this~seriously. this has made me reframe my way of thinking about this. this is so helpful. thank you so much for taking the time to respond!!@ hey, thanks for the advice! i'll consider if i have anyone i know who i can trust like that. i do have one other question~when someone tells you \"yeah, you shouldn't have done that.\" how do you not beat yourself up over it? i beat myself up a lot, and sometimes it makes me afraid of acknowledging my faults.@ major props to you for having the guts to ask yourself whether your behavior might be the problem or not. even if it ends up not being the case, it's great that you're self-reflecting. would it be possible to ask these friends directly? just something polite and non-accusatory like \"hey, i hope you're doing well! i know we haven't been talking as much, and i might be overthinking things, but i wanted to check in. have i done something that's hurt your feelings?\" and if they say that you're just overthinking but continue to seemingly avoid you while hanging out with other people, then honestly, they might not be worth it. at that point, they're just kind of playing mind games.      i was wondering, since you say this keeps happening to you, do you have a certain behavior/s of yours that you look at and go \"yeah, that might be the issue.\"? again, it might not be you. friends come and go, and i've noticed people not on the spectrum tend to drift in and out of friendships a lot. so please try to not beat yourself up and pin it all on yourself.@ my problem comes from that any support i'm giving is basically encouraging what she's doing. i don't feel comfortable saying \"that's awesome! hope you have a good time.\" when someone is telling me they're doing something that could hurt other people. even though her actions may not directly affect me, the could directly hurt someone else. so i feel really uncomfortable encouraging that. but i also recognize that my discomfort with this could be more of \"me\" problem and will just be something i have to suppress to be a good friend. thus~why i'm in this forum. i hope that helps provide more info? if you have anymore questions, just let me know.@ this is really hard to answer~.i think my least favorite is my lack of awareness in social situations. but at the same time, sometimes my lack of awareness makes me seem confident and knowledgeable, which makes very efficient at my job. and i really enjoy that. so~it feels interconnected.@ those are good pointers. my problem is, for example, a friend is going on a trip that i went on last year (it's the exact same trip at the same hotel and everything), and they're very nervous about it. so my mind goes \"someone telling me what their trip was like would help me prepare for mine.\" the trip i had was great but definitely had road bumps (luggage was lost for a couple of days, the place we stayed had some issues like ants, etc. etc.) but it still was ana amazing trip. the problem is i'm realizing i might have stressed my friend out about the trip more by telling them my experience.@ your post is so on point about it. tbh, until lockdown i felt like it was more likely i had adhd, but now, i'm not so sure. i've been thinking, and i'm wondering if part of there being more stemming is because being home all the time means we're in the one environment that we're used to being able to stim in. so there's no change of scenery signal that tells us \"okay we're outside of home now, we don't stim as much here.\"@ ah geeze i relate. i have cystic acne so~.skin picking also makes my acne scars worse. good luck with the lacrosse ball! one thing i've considered is maybe putting non-toxic glue on the back my hand or something and, when it dries, picking it off will feel like skin picking but not actually hurting my skin.@ oh man i need some kind of bracelet like that. have you found certain types that work? like a certain material?@ yupppp same. i've realized in zoom meetings i've been doing a lot of skin picking stims, but i try to be mindful and dial it back a bit. i never had this much skin picking stimming when i was at in-person meetings. i think part of it is that there is no change of scenery. so there's no cue of \"oh this is a change to a different environment and, in this environment, i recognize that i don't stim here.\" i'm at home. all the time. home is the place for stimming, so it's just alllllll the time.@ oooooooof. i'm sorry. it was hell around july 4th in the states when everyone was setting over fireworks every single fricken day.@ oh geeze, i'm really sorry to hear about that! that's~yeah that's rough~@ yeah, like, before the lockdown i never really saw myself who stims that much (but also, back then, i didn't realize skin picking was also stimming). i just saw it as something occasionally popped up if i was really stressed. but ooooo boyyyyyyy. now? repetitive sounds? bad. i gotta sleep with a folded blanket over my head so i have just the right level of sound so i can sleep. i think it might be because lockdown is just creating a really bad lack of stimulation or overstimulation depending on whether you work and your job involves a lot of zoom meetings.@ ohh man periods like that suck. my anxiety has been going off the fricken charts lately. social isolation has also made me read into things wayyyyyyy to much like you were saying. i'm someone who needs \\*just\\* the right level of social stimulation, and lockdown has been far below that needed level. so every interaction is either too overwhelming or it starts feeling like something \"sacred\" that could be taken away at any moment.@ hi, i really don't have any advice, but just want to say that i heavily relate. i do this exact sort of anxiety reflection on things i've said in the past and just past general behavior that i didn't know was weird.@ them: don't overthink things!   me: okay \\*makes a decision without 'overthinking'\\*   them: what the hell? did you even think before making that decision?@ this is such a great point. so much of it boils down to sexism and certain traits that are understood properly in men yet shamed and ridiculed in women. being male and autistic definitely isn't easy. but it's hard when the medical field is so far behind in recognizing a condition in one gender and we have to suffer for it. i also have migraines, and guess what. migraines have been criminally understudied because they mostly affect women and up until recently, women with migraine were labeled \"hysterical\" or told they were just trying to get out of having sex. and surprise surprise~treatments for migraines are just barely catching up because of the delay in research. i could go on this for hours~.@ and if you're the \"outgoing but socially awkward girl\" then you're just considered to be obnoxious. and yeah, i know it sounds contradictory, but it is possible to be on the spectrum but not fit the \"says only two words in a conversation\" stereotype~@ sometimes her legs are kind of swollen. she's also drinking water all the time and only uses the bathroom maybe once a day. also her cough keeps her up a lot at night, and apparently that can be something common in chf. i've also wondered if maybe she has copd like you said. that's the frustrating thing. if she just went to a doctor i could know whether her problems are easily fixable or if they're very serious. but it's just guesswork and hopes that whatever is going on is in the easily fixable category.@ yeah, what's tough right now with covid is that even if i do convince her right now, she can't go to a doctor. covid is a serious risk to both my dad, my mom, and even me due to health conditions. so it's a weird situation. i'm hoping eventually my dad will finally step up to the damn plate. but i don't know. i'm also worried about her taking certain over the counter medications. with how her cough is, i'm actually concerned she may have congestive heart failure. i definitely can't diagnose her, but it's a possibility. so i'm worried about her taking over the counter meds that may aggravate some underlying condition she doesn't know she has. i'm thinking during lockdown, i may try to prod her in the right direction. but if she keeps resisting, i really might just have to walk away from it. i remember my therapist would tell me \"your mom is in her mid 60s. she's lived a while. she's been allowed to have her life, and the choices she's made are hers. you don't get to deny yourself of the chance she had because of her poor choices.\" or something along those lines. i'm still pretty split over the situation, but i really appreciate your advice and time all the same. thanks.@ yeah, if anything this has taught me that deciding to care can actually be a pretty big decision. if you care about someone/something, that opens to you up to getting hurt. but fortunately, there are some people out there who are worth that risk. i've already found some people like that, and i hope to find more in the future.@ thanks for the recommendations! yeah, i was doing counseling this spring when school was in session because the school provides it for free, and it was helping soooooo much. i can't really afford to do independent counseling since i'm on my parents' health insurance. and they would not want me to do counseling. but as soon as the fall session starts, i'm getting myself back into counseling. thanks for the advice. :)@ thanks so much for the perspective. my parents really are just living in their own little bubble (they have~no friends~.at all), and honestly, it can be really easy for me to forget how not okay their behavior is. i am hoping to move out soonish (within a couple of years). i have medical conditions myself, so i am concerned about how that may affect my independence. but your response has definitely helped encouraged me. thanks.@ it can vary because apparently my period/hormone level fluctuations have been giving me periods of insomnia lately, but i try to get 7-8 hours of sleep. during insomnia, that can instead be 4-6 hours, but when it's going well 8 or even 9 hours. i got 8 hours of sleep last night and still was feeling like this this evening. weirdly enough, lack of sleep used to/has been one of my big triggers, but within the past couple of months it's stopped being a trigger.@ yuppppppp. honestly, it wasn't until this pandemic that i started having realizations of \"oh my god? my childhood was so far from normal.\" the one thing i do hope that comes out of it is it will make explaining homeschool isolation abuse to non-homeschoolers easier in the future. we can just say, \"remember lockdown? so imagine that but for 18 years, and the person you live with is abusive.\"@ oh man, highly relatable. really, having this isolation because of covid has really put in perspective how messed up my childhood was. when people complain about how damaging the lockdown is, i just sit there going \"oh wait~right~people don't live like this all the time?\" i'm sorry you're stuck in place right now/ it's pretty much impossible to move out with covid right now. i wish you the best of luck with leaving as soon as you can though.@ yeah, exactly. i used to mourn the loss of my childhood a lot, but i've started to grow past it. but covid lockdown has made the feeling come back. literally, the start of the year was my \"fresh start.\" my first time experiencing real ge classes in person. it was going to be my launch into the \"real world.\" and then well~pandemic and now it's right back to being inside 24/7. i think what i mourn the most~and this might be a weakness on my end~is there really is very little external validation of \"yes you were abused and what you went through wasn't your fault.\" and we've all been gaslit so much growing up that having regular society also gaslit in a way just really stings. i've been really glad to see more social rights movements gain support these past couple months, and, one day, i really hope stopping homeschool abuse is one of those upcoming movements.@ i'm really sorry you were also isolated like that. honestly. i've started to feel better about my past and i'm starting to be able to move past it just a bit (therapy has been great). but what sometimes still hurts me so much is just that feeling of being~invisible. and then getting gaslit not just by parents but by people outside as well. i feel like one of the big differences between homeschool abuse and the abuse of kids who go to public school is that people can grasp that kind of? people who haven't been abused still won't be able to understand what it's like to have a father who beats them, or an alcoholic mom, or a sexually abusive relative. but i feel like, in general, society still looks at that and goes \"okay, i can understand the concept of that and how it's harmful.\" but homeschool abuse is just so~foreign to people. again, it feels like the suffering is invisible, and that's what i hate the most.@ ahhhhhh~so just sugar to get the pill down. man~it must be wild to be neurotypical and look at all these hidden rules and go \"ah yes this completely natural, and all of this makes 100% sense!!!!\" cause it sure doesn't to me haha.@ oh yeahhhhh. very much the same here. up until about a year or so ago i had \\*serious\\* issues with not knowing what counted as being \"open\" on a \"socially acceptable\" level and what was oversharing. and yeah, it feels almost physically impossible for me to lie. like you said, it actually physically feels wrong.@ hmmm, i don't think so. i feel absolutely perfectly fine, and i never lie down because i feel like i want to rest. it's only because i want to do something like watch a movie and be comfy. which, well, easy fix is i just don't lie down when i watch movies or stuff anymore. but i've just never heard of this triggering migraines in others before. so i'm curious if others get it.@ thanks for the response, and i'm sorry to hear you struggle as well. i'm glad you take the effort to recognize what is/isn't healthy behavior. we're still responsible for our actions, but it's still hard because it's not even the case of growing up in an abusive household but still seeing the outside world. it's more like total brainwash. thanks for the suggestion to look up learned responses! it sounds helpful. i'll check it out.\n",
      "i dont have discord, but you can message me on here if you need to talk!@ i work for cps, and my agency and schedule are exactly the same. my city isnt super big though.@ i hear about this narrative a lot in ed discourse, and it was really different for me so ill just throw my story into the mix. my mom was a single mom who worked quite a bit. we were kind of poor, but we did always have food. we just had a ton of convenience meals like chicken nuggets, hamburger helper, spaghetti, cereal, sooo much pop, etc. i literally ate butter sandwiches frequently. so for one, i never ever learned what it was like to be healthy. i just started on the wrong foot completely. my mom never pushed diets on me or told me i was fat or anything like that though- even though i was.  secondly, i had a lot of trauma as a teenager (and some as a child), which didnt really come to head until i was 19 and left for college. im 22 currently and not even close to recovery. i started by restricting heavily for about seven months and was the smallest i had ever been. then, of course, i started bingeing. i havent stopped. food has been my constant while dealing with all this trauma, i guess. im currently working with a therapist and dietician though, so well see how it turns out for me :)@ theo for me as well. im a social worker with kiddos and am about to start my masters program. im also a cranky lesbian lmao@ is it normal to start falling more as time progresses to a certain point? ive been skating for about two weeks and at first i didnt really fall. i know ive gotten better in some ways, but it is pretty discouraging. i cant tell if i am just getting braver and faster or if im just hitting a wall and not improving.@ i learned in a psych class that people who say homosexual are typically using it to detach the notion from the person. its less personal. it makes sense that religious people would do it to make them feel less guilty, because they think theyre talking about the concept of being homosexual, rather than using word like bi, gay, lesbian, etc.@ my therapist and i laugh so much all the time, but one time that sticks out for me was this time where i was talking about being a lesbian. ts phone or laptop got a notification (we were on telehealth).   t: oh, my daughter mustve texted me  me: no. that was an email notification sound.  t: well, no, actually it was my gaydar since im talking to you.@ also not op, but i agree with all of those. i also do embroidery, so crafting in general is a really good one.@ it usually does, yes!@ i think that it has to do with the fact that when someone sees she/her, they know its someones pronouns being listed. if it were just listed as her, it could be seen as a typo or an accidental word, if that makes sense. it also allows people to put she/they or he/they in their bios, which would be weird (or not possible?) to be expressed in just one single pronoun.  it also might just stem from the fact that we learn sets consecutively in school. remember in first grade or whenever when you learned about pronouns? they were referenced in sets.@ i work for cps, and this alone would probably not be enough to open an investigation. however, i would assume its very likely that other things are going on that would bump that right up to an open case.@ im a case manager for cps, and those lines make me cry every time because i think of my sweet little clients @ im bipolar, and i can almost guarantee that she didnt cheat on him because she was manic. she may have been manic at the same time, but people dont just throw all their morals out the window when theyre manic. when i am, i buy $75 worth of embroidery supplies or cut my hair. i dont cheat on my partner, and never have thought to.@ to me, my therapist = my maternal figure, which is the transference. but she isnt actually my maternal figure and shes not supposed to be.@ youre good! im bipolar lol, its just about me projecting my lack of a stable mom (shes manipulative and crazy) onto my therapist!!@ if you click the hyper link on the word here it should either open the tiktok app or bring you to a browser page where you can push the play button@ hahahah it says i am drew. i am danny. and we are not the same person@ i love that!! do it!!!@ im a case manager for cps. i had minors in political science and criminal justice. im planning on either going to law school and going into juvenile law or getting my msw.@ for real. my therapist and i had a whole talk about this the other day, because im going on a first date with this girl on saturday and i was saying im super nervous. my therapist told me that i always wait for people to pick me, so i end up with people who dont fulfill my needs. the moral of the story is to start picking people, and you are strong enough to handle rejection.  per my therapist of course, i havent quite executed this yet. @ taco bell is my place too. i can be doing so well for a bit and then think about a crunchwrap driving home from work, and i go buy a bunch more than just a crunchwrap @ real life social worker here. this kid is displaying warning signs we would see as highly concerning for sexual abuse. he would not be taken away, but we do help the parents get their shit together or at the very least make them consider what theyre doing is wrong. id say this is a good move, op. call cps.@ heard. ive been around it a bit before, but it wasnt like this. it makes me feel a little better about approaching them though if its standard.@ yup this is the list. just swap 929 and alanis interlude for me and mine is the exact same.@ i am literally obsessed with this. i was supposed to see her in may, and now im sad @ totally agree. i wouldnt have known this was supposed to be sarah lynn minus the shirt simply because this look is too put together. it is super cool though for sure. i actually think less makeup and photoshop in some places (eye color/eyelashes, rosy cheeks, boobs) and a lot darker makeup around the eyes would be a good place to start.@ oh i love this idea!! that would be perfect.@ im a lesbian, and i am the exact same way as op. this is pretty common because of compulsory heterosexuality. i sometimes feel creepy or like people might think im creepy for talking to them and create false comparisons in my mind between us. both of which are normal for gay people. compliments are a good way to start a conversation, like you mentioned, but it is of course deeper than that for some of us. comphet is so complex.  also labels are sometimes used to bring people together or feel accepted. the instance i was able to feel understood in my sexuality was so liberating for me. op said they are bisexual, and saying not to worry about labeling it is a little invalidating, but i get where youre coming from.  op, my therapist is helping me work through this kind of stuff, so it could be something you consider! once it is safe to go out again, you could try putting yourself in a place where you are confident (a club youre passionate about? activism about a cause you care a ton about?) and seeing what happens. i honestly also meet a ton of amazing women friends at bars!@ i completely agree. the only time my therapist writes anything down is when she has to communicate it with my ed specialist or psychiatrist, and she could just be jotting down she has to get ahold of them. some therapists in the past did take a lot of notes, and it made me feel like they didnt hear me at all.@ the food at her restaurant in omaha is actually to die for. im a regular there, which is not good for my bank account @ my dog is tulip and her nicknames are tully, tuls, miss tunnifer, lala, crunchy, crunchwrap supreme, crummy, big peenie, boppy, gibby, tu la peep, and some more im forgetting.  my cat is boy cat and his nicknames are mr. cat, mr. kitten, kitten man, male feline, and el gato chico.@ meeting with my therapist tomorrow thank god@ do it!!!@ yes!! haha@ hmm. maybe my ntonia by willa cather :) whats yours?@ seriously!!!! i just had that conversation the other day.@ thank you. so is yours @ yes, i feel this. i dont have a mom crush on her because she reminds me of my mom, its because she kind of.. doesnt.@ ohhh okay. that makes sense. when i googled it, all that came up was im in love with my therapist and thats not the case lol. thank you!@ seriously!! my top three songs are the bottom three here @ no, just an hour or so with the dietician usually, and then every two weeks an extra meeting with the doctor. they says its one hour, but its more like 40 minutes. so one hour some weeks, two-ish others.@ so for me, i was recommended to an eating disorder clinic (??) by my existing therapist to do outpatient-ish stuff. there are dietitians and doctors there, as well as a therapist, but i just wanted them to coordinate with my current one, and shes amazing so thats what were doing. pretty much i go weekly and talk with them there and they contact my therapist about what we did and what my plans are for the week. im doing dbt, so it goes pretty well with eating disorder recovery. i also just started on wellbutrin (and some other meds), which has really helped bingeing for me.@ please dont resort to only male-based history! much of history has been diluted by white men, so really most of what we know is the male-based history that ignores women, like you mention, anyway! its super depressing as a young woman hearing a lot about how life has been so hard for women in the past, but things like sexism and racism are so ingrained into everyday life, it is fairly unavoidable.  i would recommend shifting your viewpoint a little. i studied history, politics, and criminal justice in college, and i found it less depressing when i went into a class with the mindset of like.. this woman was so badass! or look how strong this woman is.   there are badass women all throughout history- here are some of *my* favorite things to learn about!  - 1960/70s feminist movement. roe v. wade and the civil rights act of 1964 were passed! some cool people to research and read are bell hooks, audre lorde, and betty friedan.  - the popularization of womens literature. id classify this as late 19th to early 20th century. people became interested in women being placed in the literary canon, and boom! now we have amazing literature. id recommend jane eyre by charlotte bront (clich i know), lucy gayheart by willa cather, and their eyes were watching god by zora neale hurston.  - women and the cold war. women have always been integral in wars, and the cold war tied directly to the second wave of feminism. id recommend the article  by kristen ghodsee. angeline nanni is a really cool lady to research.  - the french revolution. weird one, i know. but it gave women political rights! women played a huge role in the revolution, and there are so many fun things to research. some are the womens march on versailles, mary antoinette, and olympe de gouges.@ hi :) im f 53 and up to heaviest at 175, and i struggle with binge eating too. so i feel you. bed is an eating disorder that deserves to be taken as seriously as anorexia and bulimia, so please see a professional therapist (and even maybe dietician) about this! one of the only things that stops me from bingeing is making sure i eat enough at mealtimes. its hard. do not restrict anything. youve got to handle your ed first and foremost. when i tried to lose weight without treatment for them, bingeing turned to bingeing and purging. a lot of time one eating disorder will morph into another- anorexia to bingeing or bingeing to bulimia or whatever. it seems like youre already in this cycle, and you need to get out of it. go on a walk each day, fill your body with healthy meals and snacks, and please go see a professional. best of luck to you, and feel free to message me with any questions.@ yes thank you!!!!@ here are some short, easy-to-read opinion pieces/articles that might help you understand:  https://achonaonline.com/top-stories/2019/01/why-society-hates-teenage-girls-opinion/  https://medium.com/the-establishment/why-are-we-so-scared-of-teenage-girls-4b441aef7b8  https://www.shsoutherner.net/opinion/2020/01/21/theres-a-culture-of-hating-teenage-girls-and-no-ones-talking-about-it/  and here are some scholarly articles that help explain why this happens:  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305118786727  https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp-rj.2016.111206  let me know if you have any questions :)@ no. she said if you dont like those things because teenage girls like them, youre sexist. did you not read the full quote? do you not agree that if you dislike something because girls like it youre being sexist?@ oh, i totally agree with that. the article title with the subheading alone is very, very clickbait-y.@ she said because teenage girls invented that band being famous. like, teenage girls invented the beatles. teenage girls invented music. youre trying to say that somethings stupid just because teenage girls like it? its fucking insane.   and yeah. shes right. phoebe is talking about how when people dislike/mock things typically liked by women (boy bands, starbucks, hydroflasks and scrunchies, mom jeans, all those stupid tropes), its usually because of underlying misogyny. factually, society tends to belittle things that are typically enjoyed by women.  you cant just take a portion of a quote and pretend like that means they have dumb opinions. especially when she is correct, like ??? lmao.   and heres the full link for anyone with reading comprehension skills: https://www.nme.com/news/music/phoebe-bridgers-hating-the-1975-i-feel-is-sexist-2695694@ also right after that when she says so i will wait for the next time you want me like a dog with a bird at your door. i just got broken up with a few weeks ago and that one stung \n",

use to have.@ i also just got my new ender 3 v2 a few days ago.  i noticed it homed close to the bed, but after leveling the first few prints stuck nicely.  only thing i've had to adjust was belt

just that because of the age, and from what i understand on how they work, the plate coating has been degraded too much to generate enough chlorine to handle.  how old is you chlorinator?@ i hope it

and potentially dangerous to the republic. voters dont seem to be buying it.  >its understandable why trump would take this tack. after all, the unpopularity of his opponent was central to his 2016 victory. both he and hillary clinton were historically unpopular in terms of their favorability  and trump managed to parlay that into just enough votes to win the electoral college. so why not try it again?  >well, two reasons. the first is precisely that trumps efforts to dirty up biden havent really gotten anywhere and  more importantly  its not clear that a race between two unpopular candidates actually favors trump in the same way it did four years ago.  >yougov polls regularly on views of the candidates, as it did in 2016. you can see how each contest has evolved from the numbers the firm provided to the post. clinton and trump were both seen as more unpopular than popular over the course of 2016, which each having a negative net favorability. (net favorability is the percentage of poll respondents who view the candidate favorably minus those who view the person unfavorably. on the charts below, the candidate whose line is higher is viewed more favorably on net by the identified group.) so are biden and trump, with one difference: biden is viewed more positively than clinton was, and trump is viewed more positively than he was four years ago.  >note the obvious bump for trump earlier this year, when the coronavirus pandemic emerged. that faded. trumps current net favorability, in fact, is about where clintons was in 2016  which, for obvious reasons, isnt really good news for his reelection bid.  >its also not good news when considering why trumps net favorability is higher now. its almost entirely a function of how members of his own party view him. in 2016, coming off a contested primary, trump had to build respect among republicans. eventually, most of them voted for him anyway, even if they didnt love him. now, hes more popular than clinton was among democrats four years ago.  >biden, facing a contested primary of his own, is on the same trajectory trump saw in 2016, gaining ground with democrats. his net favorability with his own party has already matched trumps; if the same pattern holds, he will soon pass the president.  >again, this matters because of the importance of voters who view both candidates unfavorably. in 2016, about a fifth of voters fell into that category. they ended up preferring trump by a 17-point margin  and by enough in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania to hand trump the presidency.  >why? probably in part because he was a blank slate, someone whose lack of experience in politics allowed people to compare what he might to do with what they expected from clinton based on what they knew about her. and so he carried those voters and won the election.  >on tuesday, monmouth university released a new poll looking at the same group, those who view both major-party candidates unfavorably or, in the case, of monmouth, viewed neither candidate favorably. whom do they prefer in a head-to-head contest?  >biden, by a mile.  >i dont want to be hyperbolic, but if im trumps team and i see that chart, i start to panic.  >there are lots of ways in which they might assure themselves that things arent that bad. after all, how many people who really dislike both candidates are going to bother to vote? whats more, trumps stronger position with republicans will likely mean that he can expect more votes from his own party (although the percentage of monmouth respondents who view only trump favorably is about equivalent to the percentage who said the same thing in 2016 exit polls). and, of course, there are still nearly three months in which to erode bidens support.  >which brings us back to the point that those efforts havent made much headway yet. in fact, this same metric hasnt really budged since december. then, biden had a 33-point advantage among dislike-both respondents in a poll conducted by quinnipiac university. in april, his advantage was 32 points.  >part of this certainly reflects that, even while both biden and trump are viewed negatively on net, biden is viewed less negatively. yougovs data shows him faring better with republicans than trump is with democrats, which obviously makes an important difference. trump is about where he was with democrats four years ago at this point; biden is doing about 10 points better than clinton was with republicans.  >part of trumps victory can also be ascribed to the late swing of independents toward his candidacy. his net approval with independents in yougovs polling is currently about where it was right before the 2016 election, after that late surge. bidens net approval is about the same as trumps  but much higher than clintons was.  >theres an important caveat here that should also calm nerves in magaland. voters are much more familiar now with biden than they were at the beginning of the year, when about 15 percent didnt know enough to have an opinion. but its still the case that about 1 in 12 (largely independents) dont know much about biden, giving trump and his team theoretical space to define their opponent.  >we have to reiterate, though, that they have been trying to do this for months. bidens approval among independents and republicans hasnt really budged, and his approval with democrats has surged.  >theres another potential problem with that lack of familiarity, too. if voters go into the polling place in november (or, really, fill out their ballots at home) and have to choose between the trump the know and the biden they still dont know a whole lot about, many may go with the blank-ish slate that the democratic candidate somehow represents.  >if anyone should know the political benefit of being seen as an undefined outsider, its trump.@ nice!  well, i am going to give it a try and hope for the best.@ high chlorine

clothes on his back taken out for being a smart ass to the cops, so they return the favor by taking everything from his cell, they even took his mattress.  in my cell were 4 empty cells within my cell that were not locked and had bedding on them.  that evening i was able to pass through the bars blankets, pillow, and even the mattress, even shared my cigs with him.  when they come to check on him the next day, they were confused as to how he got the bedding, but took it again. later that day i passed him another set of bedding.  again, the next day when they check on us they couldn't figure out how he got bedding.  i kept the cells in my cell closed so they never even bothered to check.    the next day he wanted more blankets, so i passed him some more.  later that day i found out he was using the blankets to hoist up stuff from someone helping outside the window.  again when the cops come to check on us they see him with a bed and blankets and this time he is smoking and a bottle of whiskey, they were like wtf!.  they took his shit again and left scratching their heads, they just couldn't figure it out.    i passed some more stuff across just before i was let out.  cops kept asking me how he got the blankets, so clueless they were.  he didn't escape but, the use of the blankets and the cops being so confused was funny as hell at the time.@ >civil forfeiture  this shit

(you should probably read how to join and level up covenants too since some become unjoinable or unable to rank up in after completing certain points of the game. )  do as much as possible on the first playthrough, since difficulty gets harder on new game +. that way  you can use shortcuts and skip optional bosses to reduce completion time on playthrough 2. with careful planning you can get almost everything but the collect all special weapons trophy on your first playthrough. since that trophy requires multiple boss souls.   if you're trying to farm rare items use the gold serpent ring and have 8 or 9 humanity. this boosts item discovery to around 400 and will make item drops more likely and farming less tedious.   finally save scum to a flash drive if you have too. if you only have 1 of a certain slab, but need it for 3 special weapons trophy's. save and reload to get all 3. same can be done to achieve both endings without another playthrough. also make backups frequently if you do mess something up you can reload a save.   i know it's a lot but it is a complex game. by all means take advantage of whatever you can (item scumming, cheesing bosses guides etc.) to get the platinum. however i would say playthrough it blind at least once to get the full enjoyment of the game.  hope that helps and good luck getting the a platinum.@ nothing says anti-facism like controlling someones money, deciding what is acceptable literature, and vetting any purchases for wrong thought.@ i've read other people have had this problem. some say it pops randomly in the 40s or higher. keep playing or start a new save on the easiest difficulty and farm your 30 headshots quick then go back to your regular game.  this is all i can think of outside of reinstalling the game.@ pretty early on. i think while i was clearing a bandit camp.@ yes! yes! yes! lol@ horey sheit.  nice work.@ in my opinion definitely. it's just the originals with updated gfx. if you enjoyed the old ones you will most likely have fun with these.@ damn fine work. i personally hate tps, but still quite an accomplishment.@ blacks are 13% of the population but do 50% of crimes.@ congrats! not going to lie i hated the pre sequel.  good work grinding through it.@ wow, i never knew that. i figured he always was painted wearing a wig, or painted in old age so he would of had white hair. george washington was a red head. mind blown.@ i was going to say i didnt think washington had a #2 on top and grew the rest out. it was just long hair pulled back and styled as in your pictures. possibly a wig too? either way still pretty funny though.@ i struggled with it too. i think hopping around nitro crates collecting crystals just feels unnatural once you get used to flying around tracks drifting at break neck speeds. i ended up exclusively using the dpad and little to no boost to finally get them done.@ keeping the boost all the way through on tiny temple took me a lot of attempts. polar pass was a nightmare for me.  i just couldn't get that jump across the water consistently.@ thank you, i suffered at first on the oxide time trials. i had to follow youtube videos. this one channel by the name of viperian breaks down all the tracks for the time trials. he also explains shortcuts, and how to sharp turn using the d-pad, spamming the jump button, and letting go of the gas.  it's complicated at first, but if you learn it you can do 90 degree turns and keep your turbo like it's nothing.  it made the time trials and hard mode easy, or at least manageable depending on the difficulty of track.  just figured i'd mention it incase you ever want to give it another go.@ not sure about multiple seasons, although i'd assume they accumulate through the seasons. it was the last trophy i needed for the plat, and i had done 0 bounties. i was pretty much done with the game and just wanted to finish the platinum and move onto something else. you are correct with a good build it is fast, but the volume of doing 500 in 2 days just got to me. can't even tell you how many times i killed zoltun kul.@ 500 bounties diablo 3, just brutal.@ manlet against the machine@ favorite: medievil, sir fortesque standing triumphant with his sword in watercolor is pretty sweet.   least favorite: diablo 3 reaper of souls edition. it was a hell of a grind for a lame bedazzled sparkly diablo head.@ same here, i regretted buying it, but the more you play it grows on you. now i'm hoping they remake the 2nd one.@ thanks man, like 36 hours. it can probably be done quicker tho, i just was slow finding all the stuff on each level.@ brther, you're a fucking mad man. outstanding work.@ nice work! did you get tools of destruction too?@ i too went with the man spider platinum pic.  very nice!@ cool collection, do you have t.r.a.g for the ps1?@ boss trophy man, i have both evil withins on my to do list. word is they're pretty brutal to do.@ she took the dough and rolled it up into a ball, and we were going bezerk, and she loves that kinda stuff and i, i admit i do too. lol one of the best episodes imo.@ awesome job! i own this one but the platinum seems pretty intimidating.@ diablo 3 isnt too bad..just time consuming like most arpgs.  all the trophies come pretty easy and naturally as you play. except for \"batting 500\". you have to complete 500 bounties (end game replayable missions) .  it is absolutely brutal for being repetitive.  a trophy has to really suck ass to remember it by name.@ alright, makes sense. now you have me wondering what the change in story is and if i'll have the same feeling about it. thanks for the reply, and not giving any story details away. i appreciate it.@ why did the story disappoint? just wondering, i was going to start this one next.@ meh cooking can be a learning process. the real question, is that a ham onion and red pepper pizza?@ gameplay is very fun but can be challenging at times. the story is simple. it's a ps1 era game that isn't ff7 or mgs so it isn't an epic tale, but it's still entertaining.   the story w.o. spoilers is: you're a fraud/mistaken hero raised from the dead by your old nemesis and given a second chance in death to stop him and prove yourself worthy of being a true hero. i guess it would qualify as a platformer/action game with puzzles and a pg horror theme.  maybe a similar game would be maximo? idk it's kind of its own unique thing imo. it usually goes on sale for 15$ on ps store. i think it's definitely worth that.  oh there's also books throughout the game and a bestiary filled with lore and information.  they are optional reads, but do provide lots of supplementary information if you really want to get immersed and are looking for more story.  hopefully that gives you an idea what it's like. i don't want to ruin anything by saying too much if you do pick it up.@ thank you. i didnt even know there was a 2nd entry. medievil 2 or a new entry would be sweet! maybe it'll happen on ps5.@ mgs is like devil may cry or rdr2 to me. in a way that i know i will never platinum it. damn fine work right there.@ thank you sensei@ oooo boss trophy man. i hear the dmc's are brutal platinums. congrats!@ follow the guide cj!!@ yellow is normal hits. orange/ reddish colored is criticals. green numbers are health gain or regen. but  green is poison effect during nurgle levels.  while red can be blood damage over time during khorne levels. i think in slaanesh/tzeentch levels your character glows purple while under negative status effects but the numbers showing damage done to you stay red. you can see if your character is under the effect of something damaging by the icons above your skills bar. you can see the details of said effects if you pause the game and check under the 3rd or 4th character page.  this is my best understanding of it all. hope it helps @ hell of a first platinum. very nice!@ thank you! as far as tips go for the platinum this will be long so hit the tldr at the bottom first. most trophies will come with natural gameplay progression, and all the trophies come pretty easy, they're just time consuming. for the difficulty related trophies (beating all bosses on chaos 2 and one on chaos 5 difficulty in boas rush mode) i used bragi (the dwarf).  it was easy to make a tank build with his skill tree and jump up chaos levels as i acquired better gear.  the easiest way to find better gear is by doing relic hunts. these are part of the end game, and also 50 relic hunts are required to be completed for a daily grind trophy. they're like rifts from diablo 3. the higher difficulty relic hunt, the better drops and rewards. don't be intimidated by the difficulty level, it took like 1.5 hours of doing relic hunts to have superior enough gear to jump from very hard difficulty to being equipped enough to do a chaos 5 difficulty boss.  if you're familiar with arpgs you can easily run the game at very hard your first playthrough which will make your end game easier. the dwarf and wood elf are very fun to play. the mage elf is so-so. the human character is brutally boring imo. so i would recommend playing as the dwarf first and getting all non campaign trophies with him. then playing the story out as the elf mage, then the human and finishing out as the wood elf.  that's how i did it and the wood elfs play style made the last story run feel fun and not grindy.  when you play as the human grind until you get the sprint shield skill, set the difficulty to very easy and sprint through those levels like a bat out of hell.   tl:dr play as the dwarf first on hard or very hard difficulty.    refer back to this post after you finish the campaign for details about a few intricacies about end game trophies and character play order.  for god's sake keep a tally of your relic hunts so you dont go crazy waiting on # 50 like i did! this game is a pretty mediocre diablo 3 clone but is fun enough if you like arpgs and warhammer! have fun and message me if you get stuck. i'd be happy to clear anything up. good luck on the grind!@ almost the right game, i appreciate the effort trophy bot.@ top tier boomer logic.  someone has to do the job.  these same people bitch when service and quality are subpar. maybe if (insert billion dollar corporations) could spare an extra 5$ an hour the guy making your mc-whatever or associate at a big box store would give half a shit and service wouldn't suck. i could go on and on but these are the same feathery fucks who dropped out at age 16 in 1975 and got no diploma union jobs that could buy a house, car and support a family. those that did pursue higher education paid a joke in tuition and found well paying jobs out of college. i could rant on and on but my blood pressure is rising. solid comment man.@ nice, maybe you'll have time to get to the cloud district now.@ step 2 is duct tape, but this incredible!\n",
      "maybe that's my problem i try to hard because i love my man but sometimes it don't happen when i want it to@ yeah ultimately i will just for a day@ he's pretty nonchalant about it and keeps saying things like it's cool that's fine. i tend to over think things and took it as him trying to spare my feelings@ but i miss them my father passed away and even though it was two years ago every time my phone rings i have thoughts that someone else has passed. my mom is the only parent i have left and i have gone a year without seeing her, i'm just concerned and miss her. you do understand don't you.@ i meant disrespectful to not spend it with@ because technology it would be our first thanksgiving together in a way if i could i would split my time with both but i live four hours away and i wanted to start our firsts together but you're right it don't matter just wanted to see if i was being disrespectful@ he's super paranoid about covid he says he don't feel safe or comfortable and honestly i don't think my mom will feel comfortable with us together in the same bed don't ask why just trust me@ thank you i proposed that exact idea but wasn't able to get my schedule modified@ i will just trying to figure out if i should on turkey day or day after@ he's a home body and he's super paranoid about covid@ i feel like i'm abandoning my fiance, like being with him don't matter when in fact i value his time@ this is so beautiful it's scary@ my daughter's father did the exact same thing but she was 9 when he asked to be a part of her life even moved in convinced me and the court he was home for good and we were getting married. had cs stopped and left again soon afterwards. now i'm engaged to a great man that my daughter greatly respects and he still in his mind is confused as to why i won't talk to him if i had to do it again i would listen to my gut feeling i had the first time and not let him back in our lives. hope you make the right choice not just for you but your child as well@ and i did ask do better how he said if you are tired i will wash dishes we take turns cooking today he texted me and said he would take care of dinner tonight@ i talked to him earlier and told him and he said he would do better and kissed my forehead he said he was a ride or die and if there was something that made me unhappy to just let him know. so definitely will communicate more.@ perhaps but i do want to give it a fair shot to be honest there isn't any abuse we laugh together a lot we enjoy each other's company and he had made so many major changes since we moved in and has tried to accommodate me and my daughter from day one i just need to speak up and talk he does ask me what's on my mind a lot and he is genuinely concerned about what i think so maybe stop holding back and just let him in@ yes and no i am a little timid about speaking up so don't know how to approach the situation never been a confrontational person he has a room just for him when he wants some alone time i don't go in when he's in there and yes our money is sperate accounts are separate as well as credit cards\n",

overprotective/helicopter mom while he is out on bail.@ \"you said it wasn't your responsibility to make those kinds of arrangements\"  that was not meaning the daycare should file a restraining order. i have an order of protections out but sadly thats just a piece of paper.@ sperm donor is abusive and uses them as pawns. my previous landlord was caught with lewd pics of my girls and i on his phone off a hidden camera he put in my rental.   ive had credible threats of retaliation for ruining their family name. this is more than just being a helicopter parent and smothering them. im trying to keep my girls safe.@ it's my job as their mother to keep them safe even when they are 80. it shouldn't be on me to rearrange anything. i don't work there.@ if it was a big enough change i should have been contacted to discuss it. not a reminder slip in their folder. the attitude from the teacher was \"no big deal, it's only a few hours\".@ if they had grounds to terminate because of it they shouldn't have let me enroll them in the first place. i was told it was no problem when i signed.@ i'm not asking them to raise my children, i'm paying them to take care of my girls m-f.@ it shouldn't be my problem. they knew months in advance that the twins in the toddler room are not allowed to go.@ the pandemic has absolutely nothing to do with why i don't want them going.@ i can not keep them home. i'm paying the daycare to take care of them. they knew from day one. i shouldn't be scrambling to find somewhere else for them to go@ i'm already boiling hose water to cook, i can not afford to take a day off. i pay the daycare to take care of them@ that isn't anywhere in the agreement. i'm paying them to take care of my kids.@ i'm glad you asked this! the director said it was no problem at all. granted this was pre pandemic but i wasn't contacted to ask if my decision changed.@ i'm glad you understand! i'm not asking for special treatment, i'm paying them to care for my children and respect my choices.@ i can't take off work i'm already struggling as is. it is just the toddler room going. edit: why the downvotes for saying i'm struggling?@ i understand a school doing that but not a daycare.@ no clue but i did not want it to seem like i said *no* because of the pandemic.@ i'm paying the daycare for care@ exactly. i'm glad i saw the reminder paper.@ i'm glad you mentioned to check on the day because my gut is telling me they might take them anyway.@ i never said the trip was getting cancelled. if this was a school trip i'd entertain the idea of finding a different arrangement.   this is a daycare- i'm paying them for a service.@ yes!!! exactly this.@ i made it clear on day one so this isn't a surprise on them. i don't work there so it's not my responsibility to make sure they do the job that im paying out the ass for. i can not miss work.  edit: why would my toddlers get bullied because the teacher planned poorly?@ nothing has changed in allowing them to go. from day one it's been a *no*@ it has been a *no* for any of that since i first enrolled them.@ right!? thank you!@ thank you!@ i don't expect them to cancel it, they just can't go. i'm already paying out the ass for daycare?@ still too young for school but thank you!@ i drank hose water every summer growing up.   it was comments (now removed by mods) saying i was giving my girls brain damage and how i should just get my water turned on like it was my choice. also said it was a non negotiable need. like i could make money appear from thin air.@ thankfully i've never had to try toilet tank water.@ i think so too!!!@ it was a post a few days ago but the comments got removed by the mods, thankfully. still get dm's though.   i wanted to comment \"if i'm such a horrible mother would you like to pay it for me since money seems to grow on trees for you?\"@ i appreciate it! :) i wanted to comment \"if i'm such a horrible mother would you like to pay it for me since money seems to grow on trees for you?\"@ you just brought back a memory of when i use to drink out of the hose every summer. i made the mistake of going right for a drink and it was hot hose water, ick.@ i hope so too. thank you@ exactly!!!@ me too! thank you@ aw, thank you@ thank you!@ i'm rooting you on, please keep me updated! i was just about to have to find another job and wouldn't be able to see my girls at all so the leap i took was a big one.  i know alot of single mommas have to be away from their kids for longer than they would like.@ i really try to not feed the trolls but for some reason that one really got to me. i wasn't asking for help to get my water on, i was sharing a \"umpkin\" story. just doing my best at making do.@ rooting you on! thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ wow this one made me teary. thank you! :)@ i did too!@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ i thought i totally blew it. thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ absolutely!!@ thank you! :)@ thank you so much! :)@ thank you! :) happy cake day@ thank you! :)@ i hope so! thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ i get my check in about three weeks so i def will post a pic :)@ i used the hose all summer long with friends! i recall a few times having random neighbors offer it to us lol.@ thank you! :)@ thank you! :)@ the comments are gone now but i had one harassing me to no end over it. telling me how horrible i was and that my daughters are 100% going to have brain damage. belittling me because i didn't qualify for help.@ i'm glad! thank you! :)@ thank you :)@ thank you so much. i too, remember the good ole water hose in the summer. sharing it with the neighborhood kids when we weren't allowed to keep coming inside.@ looking now it seems the comments were removed. i absolutely appreciate the helpful tips.   it was the relentless belittling me after i politely told them i didn't qualify for assistance for my water. and of course the dms.   thank you!@ when i get my first check we are ballin' to the grocery store :) thank you!@ thank you!!@ you are one badass momma, congrats!@ to you as well! thankyou@ thank you!@ only one way to go, up :) thank you!@ exactly, you are so right. thank you!@ thank you!@ thank you!!@ thank you!@ thank you so much, how sweet are you?! we will celebrate by getting groceries that aren't ramen and pb crackers, we can't wait :)@ i wouldn't call myself weak, everything from the past few months just clotheslined my feelings.@ 100% agree@ thank you for this idea!!!!@ thank you@ thank you laura. i was trying to be polite as possible. i can't make money appear from thin air.@ i can't tell if you are trolling me.@ i don't, sorry.@ there is not a single person on earth who has more time and interest over my kids, than me. just stop, please@ what?@ thank you@ gosh this just reminded me of my sassy twin pushing the cart in the store giving me a \"flat tire\" screeching \"beep beep\"@ thank you elmosfriend :) my chunk baby loves elmo!@ the upside of all of this is now i know to bring a puke bag for anything \"scary\".@ thank you! i guess you don't truly understand until you experience it. sadly so so so many people are in need but don't qualify. sometimes even if it's life or death for someone.@ isnt it fascinating how stubborn a toddler is when they are in the zone? oblivious to anything else.@ umpkins for everyone :)@ what are you trying to prove here by threatening me with cps?   i can not get any help. i can not get any help. i can not get any help.  it is non-negotiable but aside from robbing a bank i have to wait. there is no magical money tree that rains down on people who are struggling. i could quit my job and live off the state easily but then the issue would be that i'm lazy and a mooch.@ i gave details because i was asked. i can not get help and i can't do a damn thing about it.@ i just wanted to share a funny umpkin story. the patch was $10 and after the last few months of their life being flipped upside down, they deserved a little treat. getting my water on is my number one priority. i've begged, i've pleaded, i've done everything except steal.@ i looked at that sub earlier but they help with amazon wishlists and small cash donations. i don't want ripped apart for asking for $380. i'm doing the best i can :) thank you@ i know it's not the best option but i can not get assistance, i appreciate your concern. i really really appreciate it.@ it wasn't shut off. i had a balance on my old home so i can't turn water on at my new place. but i agree!!! i know in winter the power cant be turned off either@ i love that movie! if it was up to her she would send out a search party with k9's for umpkins@ rolled right off the dang car roof!@ $380. i had an outstanding balance from my move. i received help when i initially moved to michigan so i can't receive more. not to sound rude but if i had a way to get help with it, i wouldn't be boiling hose water. i appreciate the concern@ i just wanted to share about the umpkins. as politely as possible, i can not get assistance.@ i've called and tried everywhere. i do not want to live like this but i \"make too much\" for any help.@ detroit. i \"make too much\" for any help. i had a balance from my previous home so they won't turn it on at my new place. i know it's not the best but i do boil it.@ you too! thank you :)@ i don't have water on at my new place until i can afford it. i've been cooking with boiled hose water.@ thank you so much@ gas stations and daycare showers have been our life for the past few months homeless, i feel like a pro. not proud of it.@ i don't have water on at my new place until i can afford it. i've been cooking with boiled hose water. we usually shower at a gas station or daycare in the mornings. but she won't sleep until she is clean :)@ id rather not, just doing what i have to do. yes, i have permission from them. not stealing.@ i'm pretty sure the whole block knows about the umpkins haha.@ thanks!! :)@ i'm hoping so! thank you@ it was a nightmare that still isn't over but we are safe now! :)@ thank you so much!@ def did not buy a house, i wish! i didn't go with a private landlord this time, i went with an agency after my nightmare. so technically they have a key but it won't be shared with the landlords family like my last one.@ my why; fixed it https://imgur.com/a/woxuoru@ thank you! two toddler mattresses pushed together, we are cozy!@ hahahaha omg better erase the history!@ this is how it turned out :) https://imgur.com/a/pmqskke@ you are

all but i've already been harassed for sharing my story trying to get \"free s*it\"@ yes, he was! he had a few hidden cameras in the house i was renting from his father.   before i moved in i did a background check on the father and nothing came up. his son took over a month or two after and i didn't think to check him too. my mistake.@ i just don't have family to celebrate with so i figured reddit was second best! i'm not accepting amazon gifts or anything for this exact reason. hope someone who needs a little inspiration comes across one of my posts.@ am i asking for donations?@ yes,

happy as i am with what we have :)@ since nothing physically happened and since it was my choice to leave i didn't get any victim services. it's frustrating because this man had hidden camera pictures

food?@ it's truly a you don't know how it is until you experience it firsthand. i hope someone might see this and be encouraged to not give up.  thank you, prayers your way too.@ update: lawyer said the storage company is not responsible since i did not have insurance but i can try to take it to civil court since they didn't contact me about the flooding. the unit is a total loss and i'm suppose to move in two days. always get the insurance!!@ i don't know how to update so that people see but my lawyer said they aren't responsible. i can try to take it to civil court since they didn't contact me about the flooding.@ because it was a large leak that affected numerous units@ ok so they are not allowing me to continue doing business with them because of my  threatening behavior. my are you fu*king kidding me after the snide remark about my stuff not being nice enough to bother trying to save is the only time the tone of my voice changed.   i never screamed, argued, i was only asking why i wasnt notified the day it happened. i did not have insurance and im meeting with a lawyer when im able to to look through to see if i can sue via small claims. i move in two days anyway but my unit is a total loss.@ other units were affected too. i didn't have insurance but they should have notified me about potential damage the day it happened. they can't enter the unit but they should have called.@ i'm getting a lawyer since my unit is a total loss and i move in two days. everything is wet and mildew/musty@ exactly@ that is exactly what i'm doing. it's a total loss@ thank you!@  i did check out a local place in search of a mattress so we have a place to lay but it had noticeable bed bug evidence. i know beggars can't be choosers but i cant afford anything, let alone afford bed bug treatment. i am still searching though, thank you!@ i will be getting a lawyer to look over it when i can afford to. thank you@ i'm looking into it, thank you! it smells mildew/musty already and i move on the first after being homeless for a few months with my girls. my whole life was in there.@ i do not have any type of insurance so i'm really screwed. it does say they notify if issues arise, which they did not. a five minute phone call when they discovered the flood would have saved my things. then to be rude about my things not being nice enough to worry about has me upset.@ thank you so much! they knew about it flooding the day it happened. i'll be sure to elevate and get insurance in the future@ yeah i figured it out. they aren't responsible but dang they could have let me know so it wouldn't have sat for days. it does say they will notify if there is a issue but can not enter the unit without me. i wasn't notified@   i didn't complain to the guy, i simply wanted to know what happened and why i wasn't contacted. everything sat in water for days and i did not have insurance but i should have been notified so i could have attempted to save some things. i swore once after i was told that my things were not nice enough to be upset about. extremely disrespectful. thank you my questions were answered.@ i didn't get the insurance because the day i got the unit i barely had the money to rent it and now that mistake/issue is going to cost me even more money that i don't have.@ i'm going to speak with a lawyer regardless. i don't have the money to even try and clean my furniture let alone replace it. fingers crossed a lawyer works. thank you!@ i'm so mad that i wasn't able to even ask questions about it after the employee made the snide comment about my stuff not being nice enough.@ i most def am! i figured out it happened to six other units in the area where my unit is. i didn't select insurance so i'm pretty screwed but they still should have called the day it happened so i could have had the chance to save some furniture and not let it sit for days.@ yeah i'm seeing that now but i should have been notified the day it happened.@ i wasn't blaming the employees, accidents happen. i was more upset that i was never contacted about it the day it happened. the furniture/mattress sat wet for days.@ i don't know what is up with that sub but i keep getting referred to the relationship sub for my questions.@ that is my thought too! when did it become ok to just dismiss customers during a disagreement as \"karen\" and walk away.@ they don't want me or my things on the property so they gave me 24 hours.@ i was and am still shocked that i can't even discuss it. is it shitty sewer water? a pipe burst? water from another unit? is it even safe to handle? maybe i'm paranoid@ 24 hours to remove my things from the unit because i \"freaked out\". i'm paid til the second. i'm tempted to just leave it because i have no place for it right now and i can't move wet musty furniture@ no i do not have insurance.@ omg why??@ i don't even know why rules are posted on subs when the mods pick and choose who has to follow them. i got attacked for asking for help yet other users can ask for as much help as they want. ugh.@ power tripping mods and back seat wannabe mods are the worst. it's reddit, it's not as serious as they think it is.@ same here too! unless my girls are into it@ awww you go girls! congrats@ i feel you on that one. the before and after makeup pics always blow my mind@ my dog acts like a kid more than my kids do lol.@ i still

plate/bowl/cups lol@ thats how i eat too! i love raw veggies and fruit and will reach for them over chips or junk.@ what is this tatortot hot dish you speak of?@ oh my goodness, congrats momma!!!@ yes!! or even worse they would tell you when the next copy would be returned so you would go in on that day to be told \"oh sorry they decided to rent it for longer\".@ mine was called \"family video\" too! it's still up and running and has a marcos pizza inside it.@ that sounds awesome! mine was just one big store but had a little room for video games and then a black curtain room for the porn@ i couldn't wait either@ what would you eat?@ i don't have an answer for you but once he starts taking his anger at you, out on her you need to be careful. not saying you aren't careful but just something to take note of.@ gross! i bet the smell is horrible@ her twin is very quiet and sweet. anytime sassy brings it up she comes to me and pats my head or hand \"it ok you pooped you a good girl\".@ oh of course i had to. she told the restroom helper that we don't use tp and potty outside.@ when i picked them all up from daycare she ran to her baby sister and started checking her out \"oh no did mommy poop on you again\".@ they really are! i could do without her stopping every person she sees to tell them. gotta introduce stranger danger!@ hahaha true true@ hahaha omg what a sweetheart@ when i picked them all up from daycare she ran to her baby sister and started checking her out \"oh no did mommy poop on you again\".@ i'm glad! they are the only reason why i'm still

the sass is unreal@ haha i agree!@ i have a pull up if you need one hahaha@ i am glad i shared! def was not funny at the time. i picked them up from daycare and it was raining so my hair was wet. when she saw me she yelled \"you pooped again!?\"@ haha thank you!@ true, quick on your feet :)@ oh my gosh not the second day!!! glad you were able to do some damage control!@ haha thank you. life is horrible for us right now but i'm trying to see the silver lining  i hope sad doesn't stick around for you.@ i had my youngest in a moby wrap on my chest when it happened. my sassy keeps asking her baby sister if she is ok. \"memba bad boy mommy pooped on you\".@ hahaha omg. i'm not able to get fruit snacks unless i go.@ i honestly do not know, it's new. there is a little boy who doesn't listen to her at daycare. she calls her twin a bad boy too.@ it's brutal! there was a few weeks where i felt like i couldn't even sniff food without emptying my stomach lol@ i used fruit snacks as a reward and i got a bag and she snatched it out of my hands. \"no you be a bad boy\". telling everyone she comes across that i'm a bad boy.@ i think its one of those things that you dont realize matters until it's gone hahaha@ the shade and sass is too much. she made it her duty to tell daycare what happened too.@ 10 years!?@ i'm just glad i had the dog waste bag or we would be waiting until it got dark to go back hahaha@ it's funny now, earlier it was not.@ it's on my list for when i'm able. they must be awesome.@ thank you for taking the time to add directions, very helpful!@ when does your plane land? haha jk jk thank you, the thought is very kind.@ without the pantry we would be really in a bad place, it's such a lifesaving resource.@ i'm getting a lot of suggestions for the air fryer. i'll check it out, thank you.@ that sounds amazing!@ i was able i get out of my lease without paying thanks to a lawyer. i also got a week at the motel through salvation army so i'm just doing what i can at the moment :) thank you! the girls love oatmeal, i'll add it to the menu lol@ i'm in detroit :) a lot of people are suggesting slow cookers and air fryers so i'll definitely look into getting one. i usually just made everything with the stove so i'm not familiar with all the awesome little appliances.@ i try to stay away from sweets as much as i can but do you think muffins could replace the cake mix?@ that sounds really good!!!@ i was just about to ask what to put in them. i tried to make some this morning and it was a fail. i'm used to stove cooking lol. thanks for the tip!@ i didn't know you could make eggs in the microwave! you just saved my sanity right now. my girls love eggs and they are super cheap. thank you!@ awesome! congrats@ which one do you have now?@ i'm a woman! i might not have laughed at that so good thing you stopped yourself lol.@ thank you, it was all them!@ it's ok! i'm really hoping that something happens soon.@ that would be life changing.@ hi! i have two jobs and am looking for side gigs so i can pay what's left on the deposit to move in. i was doing pretty good until sept. lol stalking that would have made me laugh lol@ thank you so much!@ i saw that!! i'm going to try and make due til sept 13th for it.@ oh wow thank you for all these ideas!!@  my landlord had hidden cameras in the house i was renting and was caught with over 150 lewd pictures of my girls and i. so i'm currently stuck and struggling looking for cheap cheap meals :) i'll check it out, thank you!@ thank you! that cooler idea is genius!@ unfortunately not but i've heard great things about air fryers. thanks!@ i agree, expired seat is better than no seat. praying itll be ok til i can replace them.@ man that makes me nervous. makes sense though, fabric doesn't last forever.@ thank you, always careful.@ i feel like the last month has been nothing but getting evidence. thank you@ i'm not, but thank you!@ thank you!!@ i wasn't thinking about it being illegal, now i'm nervous. thank you though!@ thats what i figured when i made the drive home, was a nervous wreck the whole time.@ yes i forgot to mention itll be the motel and daycare, nowhere else. i agree about the accidents, really worried.@ yeah i'm worried about accidents too because i don't know who donated them.@ two years ago@ thank you!!!@ i'm looking into it now but can't afford it at the moment. hoping i get lucky and someone is going to illinois. thank you!!@ yes, he doesn't care@ can i ask why you immediately think rape?@ i'm trying so hard! yes, rid@ thank you!@ thank you for the tips!! i've had it before and the antibiotic was a miracle once it kicked in.@ i can clean, change oil, tutor children, asl classes, i have experience in peel and stick flooring.@ i was given a script but i can't fill it right now. does ibuprofen work pretty good? it feels rock hard.@ do you have any tips!?@ good luck!@ i second this!! i've tried almost every kind the stores have and this is the best!@  you are not making anything worse! i'm scared and have no one to turn to like i know i would if things were different. i feel robbed of my safety@ honestly,no but i'm trying to keep my head up. after my creep landlord was caught with pictures of my little girls i broke my lease and left. im now struggling to find a way to get the funds that im short to get us out of the car. which makes me so emotional because in a different world my dad would be here for me. it's all just too much right now.@ that's a really good idea, i haven't done that in awhile, thank you.@ no i haven't. half of the years were spent in denial and the other has been raising my kids and it's not feasible to try to get a therapist for the foreseeable future.@ i know i'm just extra emotional because i'm in a situation where he would have saved me. for 20 years i had a knight in shining armour , i always had a voicemail telling me the road conditions as if i didn't see it myself. i wish i knew what switch they flipped off to be able to completely rid me from their lives and still be able to enjoy life.@ i'd come up with excuses as to why he didn't say anything. oh he must not have recognized me oh maybe he is blind in one eye now@  i'll still hold onto the thought that maybe one day things will change until the day i die. i'm really emotional right now because i'm in crisis but  i understand everyone has different coping mechanisms no matter how shocking or who it hurts. that doesn't mean it hurts any less. he saw me in the grocery store when i had just had my twins and he didn't even give me eye contact. the man who raised me for 20 years and had not seen me for a few years back then couldnt even acknowledge my existence.@ it's been almost 8 years and ive reached out a few times a year and am literally left on read. i use to think that though, that at any given time i would get the call to come home.@ no, its not now. the charges are a few years old. i think by the responses on here it shows how tenants are treated if they ask a potential landlord for a reference or additional information about the landlord.   told that im being entitled, naive, whacky, and unreasonable. immediately denied or passed over because the landlord is the only one who can ask for as much information as they want to feel comfortable with the tenant.   childlike for wanting to know whose house im living in. i should just accept the next first place that is available because im a single mom and i'm  not going to get you what you want (which is safe affordable housing with a reasonable landlord). the attitude of  we make the rules, not you.   i made this post as a reminder to potential tenants to not make the same mistakes that i did and to just be careful that's all.@ it is your property and it's your right to decline anyone that you want. i'm not entitled i'm just offering suggestions to tenants to protect themselves based off my experience.@ of course you would have to ask permission first. i made the post just as a reminder for tenants to be extra cautious when dealing with private landlords.@ thanks!!@ that's my thought process too. with how little people care about each other it's good to have record of your communications in case something completely weird happens. i know about the consent and a landlord shouldn't have a issue with being recorded. there should be a mutual understanding between landlords and tenants.@ i guess if you have never been burned you aren't afraid of fire. i didn't say personal information about the landlord but to run the name on google and ask if there is a red flag. thanks for the good luck, it'll be the second place on my own. have a wonderful night.@ easy now, i didnt mean to record the initial walk through. i think the problem is being labeled as weird or strange for wanting to know whose house im going to be living in. just as you have the ability to pass on a tenant, tenants shouldnt be looked down on for having requirements too.   i guess im just whacky because i found out the person i was renting from has a rap sheet that includes crimes against women and children who had pictures of my girls in his phone  and im feeling stupid and guilty and want to remind people that even if they can't afford a super nice place to live they still have the right to protect themselves. and to not rush into the first place they were accepted, like i did.@ i'll check it out thank you for thinking about my situation. i think this post is somehow painting me as a paranoid mother who cant afford anything. its hard to have to come up with deposits and three months rent when one is not expecting it.@ i'm glad to hear that you are able to politely decline a tenant but it's important for a tenant to be able to know who they are renting from and it shouldn't get them disqualified for asking. i mentioned my neighbor had recently moved in and i'm glad she didn't know who he was or i wouldn't have known about the pictures.@ very good suggestion! thats what i meant by private because a rental company or real estate have safegaurds in place.@ fixed@ there, i learned.@ definitely a nut. id never be able to forgive myself if something happened and i didnt know he was a legit creep because i didn't take a minute to check him out. it's very common for landlords to have requirements to protect their property. tenants need to protect the family that goes into those properties.@ saving everything i can to get into a new place. i was able to break my lease and move out in a day. frustrated that i'm in this situation which was out of my control. thank you for asking@ thank you for the suggestion. i have been calling daily@ no i don't@ thank you!@ i would like to add that i didn't say the home invasion was a civil matter. it's a civil matter for my landlord entering my house without notice for the second break in.i've received help from a lawyer so no, outside help is not off the table. i posted this overnight for support before i was able to contact one.@ are they sold online or in-store like wal-mart?@ thank you so much@ he went with my to add his statement and footage to the report. thank you for the tips.@ thank you so much.@ thank you i'll check nest out.@ my inbox isn't flooded. i'm sorry you dealt with stalking. i hope you are in a safe place too.@ thank you!@ i'm sorry you think my current situation \"doesn't add up\". i'm not asking for anything but to get my situation attention. move along if you don't like it.@ i took a break from reddit. every single account on reddit has once been a *week old\". i posted to give my situation attention.@ i didn't think of securing the windows! i'll see it to my list. thank you@ thank you!!@ i'm getting help from a lawyer to get out of my lease early and i'm going tonight to look at a new place that has security.@ responded@ daily!@ thank you so much!@ i'm getting help from a lawyer to get out of my lease early and i'm going tonight to look at a new place that has security. it'll be awhile before i can save the money but now i have a \"out\"! thank you!@ i'm calling daily for updates because this is not ok! predators like him  who have the cocky attitude of \"i own this house i can come as i please\" don't have just one victim. i'm getting help from a lawyer to get out of my lease early and i'm going tonight to look at a new place that has security. it'll be awhile before i can save the money but now i have a \"out\"!@ those are on my list for when i'm able to get them, thank you.@ thank you that is such a sweet offer!@ yes, i was told it was more appropriate to post on the relationship sub first and then posted here too. i was confused because i'm not in a relationship with my landlord@ thank you i ripped my place apart looking for cameras@ looking back to his behavior after the first break in should have been a red flag. i posted in a different sub about my landlord refusing to pay up front and everyone told me that it was so weird and illegal.@ adding to my previous comment i totally understand feeling crazy!! i felt like a nut job until i started piecing things together and then it got creepy. i'm getting help from a lawyer to get out of my lease early and i'm looking at a place tonight that is gated with security and it'll be awhile before i can save up but knowing i have a option is such a relief!!@ i agree with you! it'll be awhile before i can save up but a lawyer is helping me get out of my lease early and i'm looking at a new place after work. it'll be amazing to have a end goal and get completely away from him.@ hi! i'm i'm actually getting help from a lawyer to get out of my lease early and i'm looking at a new place after work!@ i'm actually getting help from a lawyer to get out of my lease early and i'm looking at a new place after work! it'll be awhile before i could get the money for it but it's so nice to know i have options! i'd rather get away from my landlord completely. thank you for your suggestion@ oh wow i didn't think about reporting to the fbi. it makes my skin crawl that someone has pics of my kids. i really appreciate the info and suggestions! i'm actually getting help from a lawyer to get out of my lease early and i'm looking at a new place after work! it'll be awhile before i could get the money for it but having the option is such a relief!!!@ i'm keeping communication at a bare minimum. is \"lifeprotip\" the name of it? it wouldn't hurt to do another check!@ no clue but it was unplugged and pushed back in place@ thank you!@ i don't have anywhere that i can go and it's too hot for the car. i'm looking into shelters. i'm frustrated because i pay to live here and i can't even do that safely. i'm calling for emergency assistance as well. i hope that isn't rude, i'm just exhausted and angry.@ thank you! it's definitely the weirdest thing i've ever had to deal with.@ i'm blasting it all over where i can. internet friends are just as good, if not better than \"real life\" ones. i am so sorry for what you went through too! it's disgusting how predators think it's ok to spy/stalk/harass women.@ thank you so much for finding this for me, i'm overwhelmed.@ thank you!!@ nobody pinches pennies harder than me! (trying to be funny). i have a nice list of all suggestions people have given me in things to buy when i'm able to and i'll be looking into a firearm when i can. door stops are a great idea!@ i've already been harassed for \"trying to get money/things\" from reddit so i'm not accepting anything i just want to give my situation some attention so that someone has a record of what's happening, even if it's internet friends. i'm so sorry you dealt with stalking the fear is something you won't understand until it happens to you.@ i tore my place apart and didn't find any.@ a few have suggested ring so it's on my list. thank you so much for the suggestions! it seems like it's exactly what i need. do they have indoor cameras too as well as outdoor/nightvision?@ i just wanted to get my situation some attention and get some advice on things i can do until i can move.@ i really can't just pack up and leave. i have a full time job and no money. i've got some great advice here on some things i can do until i can move which i'm so appreciative of! the concern is overwhelming but greatly appreciated.@ unfortunately i don't but thank you for the suggestion!@ i tore my place apart and found none, thankfully.@ it is so scary but i'm not making a gofundme i'm already being harassed as trying to get money out of reddit so i'm not even responding anymore but will update everyone when i can.@ my thoughts exactly! i'm not in a relationship with this creep@ hey i totally understand your point but i'm not trying to get money out of reddit. i'm blasting this all over where i can so that someone at least had a record of my situation. it might be pathetic to rely on internet friends but i just wanted to give my situation some attention. i won't bother commenting anymore.edit: and you are damn right about no-one having sympathy in the real world. it's revolting and disgusting that i'm being blown off. so thanks@  i'm trying@ i'm looking into the shelters locally but concerned with this pandemic and being exposed to it.@ yes i'm we are ok and safe right now, thank you for checking!@ no family but my neighbor did go with me and give her witness statement!@ i don't know why this made me cry but streaming is something i would have never thought of so thank you so much for the suggestion that would definitely give me some comfort! my fridge was unplugged but no unmentionables are missing. i didn't even think of that. i've been walking two hours round trip to work so that i can keep my car in the driveway as a way to make it look like someone is home.@ i will definitely be getting cameras when i'm able and the live stream is such a good idea!@ oh my gosh thank you for the idea, i can actually do that with what i have at home!!! thank you@ thank you for the suggestions! i don't qualify for help on reddit and i've tried just about every loan company available but my \"no/limiyed\" credit history is making it impossible.thank you so much@ i'm definitely going to look into security as soon as i'm able. does ring work indoors too?@ i agree 100% but i can't afford to break my lease and come up with a deposit and two months rent for a new place. it makes me skin crawl that he has pictures of my kids. i can't get out but trust me, i want to so badly this is so bizarre and i hate that i have to wait around to see if anything else happens.@ yes i have and was told that the relationship sub was more appropriate which i didn't agree with but i took it down. it's so frustrating.@ i appreciate the concern. i'm kind of using reddit to try and share where i can so i have at least someone who knows what is going on even if it's internet friends. i moved across the country so i haven't made friends locally yet. sadly predatory men target women like me so it's nothing new and isn't shocking.@ i agree but i can't do any of that right now. i do have a list of things that i'll add it to. thank you for caring!@ i really wish i had met at least one friend here! i have made and a personal alarm. therapy is in the works too. luckily they are young so they won't remember this, hopefully.@ i have mace and a personal alarm. i have three babies to protect and i will do whatever is necessary :)@ i was told the issue with my landlord was civil if i didn't have proof it was him. for the armed home invasion they are \"looking into it\".@ that's exactly why i'm posting where i can. this is my cry for help and me showing whoever cares my situation.@ me too, thank you!@ they told me it's civil unless i have proof he went inside and him being the landlord is a \"gray area\". it makes sense as to why he is making it so hard to get repairs done by only offering reimbursement after its fixed.@ a grown man having pictures of my girls in his phone and claiming he is my boyfriend is really really unsettling. i've informed my neighbors too.@ no family/friends and no money for anything at all right now. my anxiety is through the roof. thank you@ there isn't a camera showing my door so i don't have proof of him entering. i only have proof he was around my driveway/yard from my neighbors camera.@ he is a private landlord, slumlord to be exact. i can't afford to end my lease. i can't even afford to fix my back door and get cameras/alarm. i'm sharing it on reddit to get my situation some attention. i asked in legal advice before posting here and was told it wasn't the appropriate sub. i'm scared that i have to stay and find out if he decides to escalate things. i'm paranoid too and watch too many crime shows but my gut is telling me to go.@ i didn't even think of the fridge red flag! i was more concerned with if he is confronted on why he is there while i'm at work he has a id showing its his address and nobody would bat a eye at that. i have no family or friends that could help/crash at their place. i can't buy anything like cameras.@ it's all been reported with footage and witness statement. that doesn't help me now though. i was only informed about the picture and id a little bit ago and it has escalated my fears even more.@ i went to the police station when my neighbor reported what he saw and i was told it was a civil matter. i'm definitely scared for my kids. when my neighbor told me he was shown a pic of my girls it completely freaked me out.@ no i'm not but i can't do anything about it. i'm desperate but would never do that, ever.@ i'm not either. i was offered assistance in exchange for lewd pics of my babies and then encouraged to do it if i really needed help. cesspool is right@ the user contacted me after seeing one of my posts but didn't say which one but i reported it to reddit and all the subs i posted on.@ i was horrified but others don't see a problem with it and told me if i needed the money so badly i should do it. encouraging child pics. disgusting@ i did@ i live in detroit and not in the best area but i will try that!@ i just want to feel safe in my home again. complete creeps offering loans in exchange for pics of my babies is disgusting. i just want to give up. there is nowhere to turn. thank you for the comforting advice.@ added to my list, thank you!@ i have one dog but he is a scaredy cat so he doesn't count lol. that's a good idea!!! would wal-mart have them?@ y'all are giving me so many good suggestions, i really appreciate it. anything that cost money has to wait but i'm making a list! i have three babies so my schedule is already unpredictable. i have reported both break ins and i've requested extra patrol.@ thank you.@ i just replaced both exterior doors so i'm only able to \"diy\" until i get paid. someone suggested lights with a timer too! thank you for the suggestion!@ thank you! i'll add timers to my list of things to buy when i'm able. that is such a good idea since its on a timer.@  i do have his brother but he is a big scaredy cat and wouldn't do much to scare someone off.@ good idea! thank you@ i know they are cheap i just can't afford it now so i'm looking for some solutions until i can.@ thank you so much for this! i've felt very alone. i left a abusive relationship and moved across the country from him so i'm trying to make friends. i love my babies but they arent big on giving me solid advice lol@ i would be totally fine if they made me pay for things myself if it meant i would still be in the family. advice,support,safety is worth more than any dollar amount~knowing you have your family who loves you and has your back. i try not to think about i too much but when i really need help it starts to get to me. i have twin girls and a baby and i would do anything for them no matter what!@ thank you! some things have happened that i'm not comfortable with so i'm working on saving money to cut my lease and get away from this situation asap.@ thank you! i just replaced them so i'm out of money for even food til payday but with how it broke this time is perfect for that bar!! thank you@ i don't have family or resources to get out so i just have to ride out the 6 months. i have a broken back door again which i wish i could fix and get a camera and alarm to feel protected but i will be working towards leaving as soon as i can. i have twin toddlers and a three month old. i thought living in fear was over.@ i'm worried about doing anything too big or \"ballzy\" because i still have to live here and don't have the option of the means to even replace the food that was ruined let alone a deposit for a new place.@ i have some time before i can get them anyway but thank you for the suggestions!!@ that's the plan when i can, thank you@ thank you for reminding me and i wasn't sure about needing permission to record someone else without them knowing, good to know!!!@ do you know where? that's a good price and if i don't have to have them plugged in is even better!@ i wont have to worry about holding the new repair because i can't get it done for a couple days when i get paid but i will be holding it out of next month's rent. shitty slumlord.@ he said i could take it out of next month's rent but i'm going to tell him i want it now instead@ it's scary to think about it and i thought i was going crazy when i realized the fridge was off because it was pushed back perfectly. i don't see a landlord acting this way over a rejection but i'm dumbfounded over it.@ it was empty the second time. the fridge was unplugged which was odd because it has to be pulled away from the wall to do so and it was pushed back on place. i'm spooked and anxiety attacks.@ thank you! i will be getting a camera and alarm when i can and just hold out til my lease is up.@ that's the thing i haven't had any issue until recently. i didn't even think that me rejecting him could be tied to the break in. didn't even cross my mind until he reacted weird about turning over the camera footage and then i started thinking and putting things together. my doors were kicked in before i was able to fix them and i didn't feel safe sleeping in a house with essentially no doors and my girls were more comfortable in the car.@ he is a slumlord@ oh ok. i wish this was a fictional show that i could remove myself from.@ like a what?@ yes@ yeah i really wish i could. i'm very uncomfortable and my door is once again not secured.@ just that it's odd timing since he made a advance at me and i rejected him. him being by my house when my house was broken into is weird too.@ i did report it. i've requested before to communicate either text or email but he is incessant on coming in person which didn't really bother me until recently.@ i'm not sure i might be just paranoid but the reaction he gave after i told him i turned over footage was so weird and scary. i'm going to try and get cameras next week.@ that's what i thought too. i should have mentioned that before the first break in he asked me out and i rejected him. so unprofessional and creepy. i just don't know how to protect myself and my girls.@ i wish!@ it was a verbal conversation. my only option is to stay til my lease is up but do you think having my own cameras would be wise in case something happens again? wouldn't be able to get them anytime soon but just trying to protect myself. he is 100% a slumlord.@ i did let them know when i gave them the footage.@ i still have 6 months on my lease.@ i agree 100%. i'm working it out now. slum lord or not it's a huge safety concern.@ i have to wait until i get paid to be able to pay it upfront. i'm a mom of twins and a three month old doing the best i can and i have a very tight budget with no room for even a extra candy bar at the store. it's upsetting that i do everything right and it takes 20 minutes for three thugs to ruin it all. thank you for the suggestion@ honestly that's my plan but i just paid rent and all my bills on auto pay on the first so i have to wait til payday in a week. figuring out how to not lose my job until then and worried about losing furniture while i'm at work.@ a slum lord a-hole. it wouldn't be a issue of it was just the locks but both doors were kicked in.@ very hard and it wasn't even my fault.@ it's both doors, front and back. he did reinforce my glass door that my doggy door is attached to but that was it. do you possibly have a suggestion for a board place in detroit ?@ i do not want any issues down the road so i'm doing it the right way and consulting with a lawyer. thank you@ i know he wouldn't be responsible for what was initially stolen during the human invasion i was just trying to see if it would fall on him if things were stolen while i went to work with the doors broke.@ that's what i thought!! figuring it out now i'm so grateful for everyone's advice.@ thank you so much for the info! making calls all morning.@ yeah i know that now, thank you to everyone for letting me know@ no i don't but am looking into it for the future.@ trying to respond to everyone. landlord will reimburse the door and locks but not upfront.@ it's a kick in the teeth when i'm going to lose things and it's not even my fault. thank you for the sweet words of encouragement. they are my world.@ i'll reach out! thank you.@ really? i really don't want anymore attention put on the fact that my house is basically free range but i don't think my landlord would care since he already told me the option i had. thank you for the suggestions.@ i don't qualify for victim services because i have a job which i don't see why that would matter. it's just my girls and i family wise. we have been camping out in the car because they refuse to sleep inside when the doors are broke.@ i've tried that tactic and until i get paid i'm not getting the doors fixed unless i come up with what i'm short. but that's not for another week so i'm just worried about leaving and coming back to a empty house.@ he isn't sending anyone it's on me to get it done and then be reimbursed but i can't do that until i get paid. i can't with hold rent for september? it's my front and back doors so when i leave i'm leaving my house unlocked and essentially wide open.@ thank you. i would be content with having my doors fixed but alarms are in my list! scariest night of my life i'm glad i have mastitis and was sleeping in the living room.@ thank you so much, i'm really trying. i had just potty trained my twins too and now they are having accidents again. i am absolutely flabbergasted at the confidence robbers have to think it's ok to steal. karma come quick!@ it feels like my body is on fire! add in a little recent trauma for some razzle dazzle and i'm miserable.  i had a culture done!@ yep i do. mastitis too, i've never been in so much pain!@ we will be staying in the car until i can get the doors fixed but that's a great tip,thank you!@ through the front and back door. extra security,therapy, and  cameras are on my list. my girls refuse to go back inside.@ therapy is most definitely going to be a priority too!@ thank you!trying my best to stay awake while they sleep@ getting insurance is on my list to do. my landlord put a board over both doors. not sure why i'm getting down voted i just wanted calming techniques@ thank you so much!!!@ detroit michigan@ no but hopefully soon@ the sliding glass door wasn't breached. i'm still not going back in there tonight@ which ones? i called 211 and wasn't given anything. thank you!@ of course! she came and put a board across the doors but didn't seem all that compassionate about our situation.@ unfortunately no but after today i'm prioritizing every penny into a emergency fund.@ oh gosh i'm sorry to hear that. it's so frustrating how people have no respect for other people's things. worried about the pandemic in a shelter but thank you for the suggestion. i'll do everything i can to keep them safe and comfortable. i feel like a horrible mom@ oh i will! i totally agree.@ i wish i had savings! id not think twice about breaking my lease and gtfo. i think a car is better than a shelter, right?@ i have my twins and there month old. we are going to just have a camp out in the car in just trying to calm them down. i've never seen my kid cry so hard she threw up.@ i'm a single mom so i don't have any disposable income right now nor  any savings built up. i'm thinking about a shelter but with the pandemic i'm not sure how safe it would be. this has opened my eyes  on the importance of having both.@ they were armed and let me tell you if i was armed too i would  feel a lot better than i do now. things are getting too out of control!!!@ i wish i could do all that! but for now i think we are just going to sleep in the car. it was terrifying and i don't want to add even more stress on my kids by forcing them to go back inside with busted down doors. i only have glow sticks but i'll definitely be putting alarms in when i can. thank you for the tips.@ i will most definitely be looking into getting a gun. there is no description i can give of how scared and helpless i felt and am feeling!@ i wish i could move! i'm so freaked out and so are my kids. i have no other option but to stay even with the doors kicked in.\n",
      "i feel that. i know it wouldnt be a waste per se to consume a cutting, but i also know it has so much potential to grow more. im now a member of the subreddit. thanks!@ ive been taking a bit slower these days. ive had some wild rides on deems and l that caused me to slow my roll. shrooms have always been gentle on me. probably because ive been too scared to eat more than an eighth (penis envy for the most part).  have yet to try mescaline, but when i do it will be from what ive cultivated myself for sure. i probably have about 6 or 7 feet of cacti in total. i cant bring myself to use my main cuttings yet, still trying to propagate it more/gift it and have enough stable plants as backup if something goes wrong.   glad to hear youre off opiates! im proud of you.@ blooperblonic bludgeoned*@ super jealous! the whole first set, and pitb>terrapin>china roll on night one was phenomenal! especially that terrapin. the ambient slow down jam and emotion from john building up and flowing with jeff, otiels intro and outro of the song. everything was top notch.@ haha, i get you. hell yeah! as long as there is no permanent physical or psychological damage all is fair game while tripping honestly. surprised you didnt create an entirely new type of bread or something. maybe next time ;)@ and a shame that the two nights before from the forum arent going too. i prefer both of those to either the 30th or nye.@ blatnum@ while on acid and simple loaf of banana bread.  does not compute. my brain goes brrrrrrr.   realistically for me though, cooking post peak on the comedown when i actually have an appetite (and can make sense of what im doing) is always a nice time.@ this guy trips. accreditation to say so: fellow psychonaut. good, interesting info here as a san pedro grower myself.@ whats up, fellow head?@ its all social medias fault. myspace was fine, i guess, but twitter and facebook have fucked us for sure.@ not sure if this has already been said, but in an effort to use my exercise science degree that hasnt done shit for me in the last 3.5 years:  youre warmer when bulking because the caloric consumption is causing your metabolism to break down more food for energy. the reason your extremities dont experience this is because blood travels where its needed, when its needed (just like when you get a good blood pump after a heavy set). its all in your abdomen at that point so it makes it warmer there specifically.   not an expert in insulation (nor a paid spokesperson), but id say the solution to that problem would be to layer up 5 snuggies and cut a hole in the torso.@ glad youre enjoying. honestly the whole show was phenomenal. the other main highlight was eyes of the world for me. perfect first jrad show for me to experience live. after the terrapin, too is solid (and has a dope eleanor rigby tease i didnt notice for the longest time), then they kill morning dew while still jamming terrapin.@ check out jrads terrapin. they do the full suite and go for 30+ minutes. 2/16/19 in st. louis is on spotify and is fantastic!@ thank you for the informative clarification!@ not sure if there has been updated caselaw since, but when my mom was in law school i sat in on some classes and vividly remember a case where an object was thrown and missed. ruling was in favor of plaintiff for battery.   regardless, we agree some legal action could and should be taken with a likelihood of winning. ya, i know hate crime was a true stretch, but id love to see that justice served. either way, based off the story presented, even with camera footage there is no way to prove anything race based aside from eyewitness accounts. considering those witnesses are the poor family of this asshole, i dont think anything would ever stick there.@ thats evidence for a literal criminal case for battery. potentially could even be stretched to a hate crime.@ username checks out.@ if someone is consistently hitting ceiling shots in g1, youre probably getting smurfed.@ username checks out.@ thank you!@ thanks! while i love the positivity and outlook, he already is trying to meet people in person. in our area most people in this demographic are already taken and hes had an overwhelming amount of these run ins. its not stopping him from trying though.@ thank you.@ interesting. even though im already married personally, this may come in handy for me to check out even. thanks!@ thank you!@ happy to help. best of luck to you and congrats on finishing school!@ thank you!@ thank you for all the tips!@ thank you.@ thank you for sharing your experiences. best of luck to you too!@ thats wild! id love to hear a more full version of the story. happy thats worked out so well for you!@ thank you.@ thank you for the advice!@ thank you for your thorough response as well as warnings!@ thank you very much for your detailed response and your concerns!@ thank you to you and everyone in the replies for the recommendation of match.com as well as your concerns!@ the reason for the comment was to be more coherent, as sub rules dont allow for a post other than the title. i figured i may as well give some more details to potentially get better suited answers. i also dont want to be tracked on reddit? idk how you even got that from what i said. for the second time, this is not my search for a woman. im asking for a friend. also, im not sure if you know how to use coherent correctly, as i am typing with proper punctuation at least.@ i mean, this is a one off event. he merely expressed interest and i said that i could try to get some recommendations for him. asking one question then giving him the results is less cumbersome than creating a whole reddit account for him and showing him how to use it. as such, i dont think im actively going to be a part of his online dating if he decides to go through with it. just trying to gather information and turn him lose with everything yall are saying.@ read the title, then read the comment mentioned. its the large one of the 12 total comments.@ read the reply below please. ultimately a 60 year old would be perfect for him. all the 60+ ladies hes been meeting in real life have either been married or even the widows already have boyfriends, etc. good luck to your mother!@ for one, in the post i said 50-65 (give or take), so thanks for reading for comprehension before stating your opinion. secondly, even if that was the case i dont blame him. if he wants a lifetime companion after losing his wife and doesnt want to suffer through another loss, expanding his search to 75 is not in his best interest. he also lives a pretty active lifestyle that (as a general rule) as people get older they may not be able to keep up with.   if he meets the right person (irl especially), he is beyond open minded. the age range is just a factor of probability of what he is looking for. not discriminatory, just not trying to waste time sifting through a bunch of profiles that wont work out.@ for one, in the post i said 50-65 (give or take), so thanks for reading for comprehension before stating your opinion. secondly, even if that was the case i dont blame him. if he

this for him just to be nice?  im curious to know how youre confused what one friend doing a favor for the other is.@ dont worry, he is still only sold on the old fashioned way. he had expressed minor interest in online a few days ago and i told him id do some research just in case he ever decided to dabble at all.@ *looking for personal experiences. i know i can just search google and get a generic result.*  so im 25 asking for a 65 year old. my ability to answer for myself is potentially limited by the technological age gap. my friend lost his wife a year ago and is thinking about getting into online dating now.   being younger, i obviously know about tinder and other apps. while he is tech savvy enough to have a smartphone, i think he would both prefer and have more success on a more traditional website.  i dont know much about that area of online dating, much less which one(s) a 65 year old would be more likely to find an adequate match.   plenty of fish, eharmony, okcupid, and hinge are the big names that come immediately to mind, but i lack experience with any of these sites and also dont know which ones may better serve this demographic. there may be other sites better suited that i havent even heard of. he is looking for a lady between 50 and 65 (give or take).  hes not looking for immediate serious commitment, but also is not looking for a series of short meaningless flings. something stable and reliable, while remaining independent is the optimal outcome.   any advice on which sites may provide a higher probability of quality matches would be appreciated. also any advice for someone getting back into dating for the first time in over 40 years, an older person entering online dating, or any general online dating tips are welcome. thank

missing blues, bluegrass, and jam band (if youd count that as a genre if its own).@ just a recommendation on the drunk cam situation: adjust your camera settings. i dont remember the exact parameter

ive been doing this for about a month now (played for a little over two months) and it does help out astronomically. oftentimes, i get enough to make the save im getting back to make in the first place. if i had missed them, guaranteed goal kind of situation.   with that being said, sometimes ill still miss them if ball cam throws me off. i know i can toggle, im just referring to the situations that its in best defensive interest to keep my eye on the ball the whole time getting back.@ anyone downvoting this, please check out op (u/niass2) post history. he has a loooong track

acknowledge that you can still do all of these things. most people do a more sophisticated version of it, sure, but were all technically passengers on a vessel careening through space after all. if

r/beetlejuicing@ breaking both arms may be a start~@ the only other first set i can think of that competes is 12/27/19. it still doesnt match the raw energy throughout the first like that gorge show.

first set is out of this world!!@ funny, considering double digit numbers of mgs is the threshold and breakthrough dose. youre right, it does shatter ones reality, but wrong in the dosage.@ username checks out.@ this comment in and of itself doesnt deserve a gold, but you deserve a platinum to make up for that bullshit. too bad we all work service industry and are struggling right now (except those who are unfortunately fortuned to be working in a place that ignores covid rules, those places seem to be doing great.)@ ha, i got smokestack at my first d&c show. i consider myself lucky! the deer creek show from 2019 second set had a wild truckin>smokestack>truckin situation that happened if you can find a recording.@ take my fucking upvote.@ agreed on all aforementioned subjects. i would also like to note that sure, this guy used an alias, but he still appeared in multiple interviews, wore identifying clothing, divulged personal details, had public venmo account records for anyone to see, and even publicly shared videos of and allowed external entities film his setup. dude should not be arrested in the first place, but for fucks sake. as far as fear mongering goes, just please be smart about how youre being stupid, people.@ better than $60 spent on a 72 year old woman?@ r/whooosh@ as long as he maintains the ability to use his arms, everything should be fine.@ will cost you a thigh and a leg*@ good bot@ right on, my dude. whatever works best for you. travis is dope as hell, aint nothin wrong with that.@ i truly cant believe that in over 200 comments so far, not a single person has mentioned slipknot or help/slip/frank for that matter to change your mind (i know youre just joking with the meme).  this is probably the best example. slip is pure super technical prog rock at its finest.@ read all the comments in both posts, and so far no one has mentioned help/slip/frank (or even a show/album/tour with one in it) as evidence for an opposing case. i feel like this, especially slipknot, is one of, if not the best example to change the mind of someone with this opinion.@ owsley stanley*. more specifically, augustus bear owsley stanley iii. he was their soundman, audio engineer, and undoubtedly a part of the family. he lived with certain members of the band at times, etc. i would definitely classify that as an internal affair.@ fuck the downvotes for this. gd is without a doubt my favorite band in all history, and travis scott is probably somewhere in my top 10 or 20 artists.   when im on l, music oftentimes sounds slightly warped from melodies being duplicated/harmonized slightly off pitch. almost like a train horn. this sounds wicked in dead track and cool af in travis scotts songs when his voice is running through a vocoder/synth. not to mention the dude talks about psychedelics a decent amount in his tunes.@ not really, the studio version of ripple pretty much offers the exact same thing as a live one. they dont jam it out and its played pretty much the same every time. normally you would be right, but this is literally the only universal exception.@ a.) describing yourself as waving your hands about and slurring your words nonsensically as presidential these days is surprisingly accurate.   b.) started with an extraction, ended with an extraction. nice.@ hell, ive imbibed somewhere between 50 and 75 times and i still find myself in the fuck why did i do this to myself phase every once in awhile. definitely not good for a first time experience, especially if someone starts into that loop before a peak has hit and they dont even know what to expect.@ be careful when/if you get a different batch. the same amount of paper may have much more profound effects.@ for real. like i know this family shit ive had is great and well over 100ug, but im not claiming to know the exact amount let alone bragging about it. hell, whoever laid it probably doesnt even fucking know. its way better to categorize the experiences in stages: sub threshold, threshhold, light, moderate, heavy, and heroic.   most of these people talking about eating any more than 3 tabs and then doing x, y, and z are full of shit unless what theyre eating is weak or theyve been eating a lot of it in the days prior. anything more than one of what ive been fortunate to come across will literally send you a dimension or two over. ill usually eat a third or half and be high as absolute shit for a moderate experience. the moderate level seems to be what is typically described when someone says they went and did _____ on multiple 150ug doses. 95% of the time, the only thing youre going to do at a dose truly that high is either lose your mind or buckle the fuck up, sit down, shut up, and enjoy the ride.   honestly, weak tabs are probably the reason that once someone gets something reasonable they think its a 250ug tab.  i would go so far as to say that a large majority of experienced psychonauts would even be surprised at what 100ug feels like, because it gets stigmatized as one tab though that could be as little as 40.@ a.) the trash can doesnt belong to her b.) the hypocrisy that everyone is pointing out - not wearing a mask either, rolling down the window, getting out of the car, etc. as well as filming the incident also c.) im not racist. then proceeds to have no issue with a maskless white cop get within 6ft, and calling the initial harassee boy.  seems legit.@ you wont have a choice of lesser of two evils until a third party gets involved. both dnc and rnc are bought out by assholes that will only nominate assholes theyve already worked a deal out with or were friends with from the get go.@ not trying to defend christianity as a whole in any way whatsoever, but there is a piece of information that was presented to me as factual by a non christian. the word for virgin in ancient text literally translates to woman who chooses her own husband. a mistranslation is still fucked up, but we have to pick our battles. one that is so easily disputed should not be one of them.@ so i assume you still beat the clock?@ womb*@ if it is indeed a 70 show like most people are saying in the comments, theres no way. first wharf rat was played in 71.@ i mean, was he not? aside from being related to angus young, that is?@ black may not crack, but those white teeth sure do have a lot of space between them~@ more like christian school. if they can squash millions of years down to 10,000 im sure turning 25 into 10 is easy peasy.@ to be fair, i work at a family owned business and everyone there is like family to each other. several people were on vacation, and i just did what needed to be done, i wasnt forced into it by any means. eventually someone will step up to cover my ass the same way.   with that being said, it still sucked haha. also, i agree with you about being mandated to do that. that should totally not be legal.@ once i was on a doubles bender and sleeping was pretty much all i had time to do when i was not working. i had serving nightmares each night and claim to this day that i spent a full 72 hours at work aside from when i drove and showered.@ signed up to comment about porn and got beat to the punch. dont worry, theres plenty of nsfw material here to still make it worth your while.@ more of a carry in than a carry on in this case, wouldnt ya say?@ at the same time? where is this the same time located at?@ i totally thought this was about to be a shellfish allergy story. thanks for the shamalan style plot twist!@ i was more talking his instrumental stuff incorporating wind instruments.@ well, dont leave us hanging. did you die and get fined for going off trail?@ sounds super cool! if you all want to pursue more music like this and crave some inspiration, check out michael hedges if you havent already! the albums oracle and torched are probably my favorites, but you cant go wrong.@ may i recommend, op, r/exchristian@ the doll curses you in particular for being that guy~@ *insert standard reddit comment reminding everyone of the kid who broke both of his arms *@ 100% agreed. from a guitar players standpoint, just the base level of the chords in his songs are so complex. its crazy even without breaking down the theory of scales/solos. 10/10 musician, and over time has become a 10/10 dude. all the love, dude!@ left off some regarding the last few words of your post, robert hunters lyrics are right up there with bob dylan for the best of all time.@ well, i was already going to mention this before i read the part about john lol. the good ol grateful dead, dude. im entpa and it has comprised 95% of my music listening for nearly two years now. i continue to listen as i type this.   john is playing with dead and company now which may be the best entry point for you? i was a jm fan before, but got into the dead straight from the source not dead and co.   as far as not getting sick of something, the same song was never played exactly the same way twice, no two shows have an identical set list, and the train has been rolling for over 50 years now so new sounds were constantly evolving from advancements in technology, etc.  if youre just a casual music listener, it may not be your thing, but if you tend to analyze and pay attention to the way the music you listen to works, this could be a holy grail. it was for me, at least.@ noel dagrass tysin, didnt yo mama ever tell you that no amount of makeup can ever fix that much ugly? at least you can legally drink til you forget now.@ james francno@ vote for pedro sax not sex mclovin@ somewhere in the title lies the key to a shitty soundcloud rap thats better than anything youve put out yet. cloudsound. college bound. get my little dick sucked, lost and found.@ nah, i consulted various other subreddits, and even all the horny gay dudes on reddit dont want to clap them cheeks. a vr headset is probably his best bet, that is if it would fit over that shitnest where his hair should be.@ the free ads on youtube would probably be easier to finish to than anything this chick is trying to sell.@ how low of a grit is that sand paper and how long did it take to whittle your skull into that shape using it?@ damn, it looks like your face hit every rock on the fall down from that peak.@ im 90% certain a double blind excitement involves the researcher not knowing who

etc~we have a very solid relationship and i know that we are going to be fine but i am going to do the same as you when it comes to discussing politics.  thank you for your kind response!@ sounds good.  for once, i completely agree with you!  have a good day and enjoy your life!  good luck to you in your academic studies and your latest career endeavors.   that ocean view must be nice!  i hope that you get a chance to take advantage of it today, but remember to wear your sunscreen!@ i never ever said that my mother stopped talking to me.  again, you are putting words in my mouth and making up some alternative reality.  she did not say she would never speak to me again, she said that she did not know if she could ever forgive me.   there is a big difference there.@ you are calling a 17 year old a name, entitled. as far as i am concerned a 17 year old should never, ever be called names. in another response to me you also call her self-centered and expectant other assumptions based on a single post. people cant put every single detail into a post and give all of the background that might be necessary to truly understand them and their situation, particularly regarding family systems. i am sure many of these situations are more complex and complicated than meets the eye. i am sure every one of the posts in this community have background information that we are not privy to. when responding to people and giving them advice you really should refrain from making assumptions based on the scant information you receive and calling people names. you really need to focus solely on the behavior.  a 17 year old is developing her sense of self. her brain is not even fully developed. at 17, she is far from an adult. she needs guidance, love, rules, and boundaries from her parents. the word discipline comes from the word disciple, which means to guide. we should treat our children like a velvet lined box, soft on the inside with firm boundaries around the outside. she is doing what 17 year olds do, they test their parents with their behavior. she is acting like a teenager. shocking, huh?  havent you ever heard the quote from mark twain?  when i was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant i could hardly stand to have the old man around. but when i got to be 21, i was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years. **mark twain**@ i am talking about you calling a 17 year old a name, entitled. as far as i am concerned a 17 year old should never, ever be called names.  you also call her self-centered and expectant another assumption based on a single post.  people cant put every single detail into a post and give all of the background that might be necessary to truly understand them and their situation, particularly regarding family systems.  i am sure many of these situations are more complex and complicated than meets the eye.  i am sure every one of the posts in this community have background information that we are not privy to. when responding to people and giving them advice you really  should refrain from making assumptions based on the scant information you receive and calling people names.  you really need to focus solely on the behavior.    a 17 year old is developing her sense of self.  her brain is not even fully developed.  at 17, she is far from an adult.  she needs guidance, love, rules, and boundaries from her parents.  the word discipline comes from the word disciple, which means to guide.  we should treat our children like a velvet lined box, soft on the inside with firm boundaries around the outside.  she is doing what 17 year olds do, they test their parents with their behavior.  she is acting like a teenager.  shocking, huh?

 you started the nuclear replies and mudslinging by calling me a bully, abusive to my co-workers, saying that i happily reported that i am mean to them, i am proud of voting for trump because of my financial investments, i should be fired from my job, i mentioned being abused because i like to argue and then you called me an asshole.  you also said that i turn on and off my empathy and feelings toward others like a faucet and i am trying to display myself as a perfect person which is so untrue.  i said that i make a lot of mistakes and i feel bad about them.  i am my own worst enemy and critic and i am constantly critiquing myself.      i am sorry but everything you said hit way below the belt.  you called me names and you insulted me.  you made a ton of false assumptions about me.  you called me unprofessional and said that i abuse and bully my colleagues.  these are words and statements that you used.  i can document every one of them by going back through your replies and copying and pasting your quotes.  you said that you check other people for assumptions that they make but you made so many assumptions and false claims about me.  you cannot even take responsibility for what you have said or even admit that you said those things.  i own my truth, my behavior, and my actions.  you said that i portray myself as perfect yet posting about displacing my anger toward a colleague was horribly, horribly wrong.  i admitted that and said that i felt bad about it numerous times. you said that you dont even know why i put the part about my job in my post. i put that part in my original post because i was trying to exemplify how upset i was about the situation with my mother that i displaced my anger at work. i felt bad about it.  i was not boasting, proud, or bragging about my behavior.  i was trying to demonstrate how upsetting the whole experience was for me.  the interesting thing is that i can acknowledge when i make a mistakes, take responsibility for them, and then take steps to rectify them.  you say that i mention my abuse because i like to argue.  i never, ever said that i was abused nor did i use that word.  you did.  i said that things were done to me as a child that i would not do to my children.  i never elaborated or called what happened abuse.  you did.    my mother was most likely speaking out of anger and shock on saturday when i told her who i voted for.  i am sure that she called me those names out of anger.  we have always had a good relationship and i have every faith that she and i will be just fine.  if she does not forgive me for voting for trump then that is on her.  conflict happens.  disagreements happen in real authentic relationships.  people say things that they dont mean when they are angry.  it is called the flight or fight syndrome.    no, i cannot agree to disagree with you because your comments were untrue and you spewed lies and assumptions about me.  you repeatedly said that i did not apologize to my young colleague and i did apologize to her.  i can copy and paste the e-mails that i sent to her and to my other colleagues who were in the meeting.  i worked with her for a half an hour yesterday training her even though she has a paid mentor, who did not respond to her e-mails and requests for help.  because she did not hear back from her mentor i helped her.    you said that your best friend demonstrates empathy and understanding all of the time, for some reason making an assumption that i dont.  your best friend never gets angry?  she has never said or does things that she regrets?  she has never had disagreements with her colleagues or displaced her anger?   do you know what displaced anger means?  i now realize that i may have been using concepts and social constructs that you may not understand.  you question my morals yet you got married at 16?  was that a good moral decision?  did that action demonstrate good judgment?  i loved my boyfriend when i was 16 too but i knew enough not to get married at that age and to get a good education and have a career so that i would never have to rely on a man to support me.  you say that i twist your words around but i can document and substantiate every comment that you made to me in the bodies of your replies. you were the one misconstruing the content and context of my replies, putting words in my mouth, misquoting me, misunderstanding the content and tone of my replies particularly with maleficent elk who seems to be a genuine person who was trying to help me.  our conversation became lighthearted and tongue in cheek towards the end demonstrated by our use of emojis.  no, i cannot agree to disagree with you because there is not one thing that you said to me about me that has even a kernel of truth in it.  not one.  you lied about me, you attacked my character and my professionalism at my job.  you said that i should be fired which is so insulting because i put my heart and soul into my job, a job i love and cherish, and feel so very fortunate to have.    you made way too many false statements and negative assumptions about me.  you attacked my morality and said that i turn empathy on and off like a faucet depending on the situation that i am in.  if that is not a hurtful comment that hits below the belt then i dont know what is.  you did not seek to give me advice.  you sought to blame and shame me.  and, to top it off, you ended a comment by calling me an asshole. and, i am supposed to agree to disagree with you?  think about that.  would you agree to disagree with me if the shoe were on the other foot?@ i am glad that you are determining your self worth by how many awards, upvoting, and people like your comments on reddit.  i have a real life with a real job with real clients.@ i dont know what an op is and i dont know what ta means.@ i a talking about the teenager who did not make her sick mother dinner.  you called her entitled.  here is your response:  well if you didn't want all of them, why would they go to waste if your mum also wanted them? you could of dished up 2 plates and given her the other one. win-win. you eat and you are also a thoughtful daughter cooking something for your sick mum. but you just complained instead. maybe read all these yta responses and instead of being defensive, contemplate and learn from them. you are still a teenager so still becoming the person you will mature into plus we all have entitled or lazy moments but the fact you are complaining here to see if you are justified in your actions gives you an opportunity to contemplate if this is the person you want to be - entitled.@ i do not know how.  you are so mean spirited and confrontational.  you dont seem like a very nice person at all.@ you come off as mean and unsupportive.  you called a teenager entitled.  you should not be giving relationship advice at all. you have made so many assumptions about me, twisted my meaning and put words like proud, happily reported and  abused in my mouth. i have never ever used those words. it is not okay to make up things that i said and disregard others like the fact that i did apologize to my co-worker.   please, do yourself and your family a favor and get some mental health help.  as i said a lot can happen in 24 hours and my post was written last night.@ most people respond in kind and supportive ways.  you do not.  you are mean and seem to take an oppositional approach in all of your responses.  i am so offended that you think i abuse my colleagues. i did apologize today.  read my responses before firing off your own without even listening to me.  i did not do any research on you i just read other replies that you wrote on peoples posts and you have the same arrogant and unsupportive tone in all of them.  and you do resort to name calling and insults because you have called me several names and called a poor innocent teenager entitled.  who does that?  she is a child.  that is just mean and heartless on your part.  seriously, you need to do some introspection and reflection on your own actions.  i would highly recommend therapy to you.  i would also recommend that you stop dispensing relationship advice.  you are not good at it, at all.@ i never, ever, ever used the word abused.  how would i still be employed if i did that.  and yes, your supposed best friend only has a bachelors degree.  that is relevant because she is not a real social worker, only a caseworker.  there is a huge difference and you do not understand my job nor my position.  you are just making assumptions based on one friend who is a caseworker.@ why are you even commenting on my post when you live in australia and cant even vote in the election?  what is it to you who i voted for when you live in a completely different country?  you obviously did not read my replies and made assumptions yet again.  i did apologize to my co-worker today as well as my colleagues who were in the meeting.  i spent a half an hour helping my co-worker today.  she thanked me for the apology and said that it was unnecessary because she did not think twice about what i said and she knew that it was coming from a place of stress in my life.  didnt you see that?  you dont even know what i said and again, you make assumptions and a giant leap to unprofessional and bullying behavior.  the principal was there.  i apologized to everyone today.  they understood because they are understanding people and they know me and my work.  i brought the incident up because i was demonstrating that i was so upset yesterday that i regretfully displaced my anger on another person and i felt bad and guilty about it.  i was not happily reporting that i enjoy being mean at work.  quite the contrary.  for someone who looks for people making assumptions you make the most assumptions of anyone i have ever met.  are you actually reading my comments for content or just skimming them and missing the gist of them altogether?  what time is it there?  are you tired?  have you been drinking?  your responses are really off the mark.@ who said my mother and i have lengthy discussion?  we do but not about politics..  we talk about a host of other topics.  i dont know what comments you are reading but you make a lot of assumptions and i dont know why you say us as strangers as if you are with a group of people commenting on my comments.  you have been the only one to comment tonight.  i think that you are a bit delusional.  i am debating about contacting the moderators about you and all of the misconstrued comments and words that you attributed to me saying.@ where in the world did you get the idea that i abuse co-workers?  how could i remain in the same position in the same school district for 29 years if i abuse my co-workers?  my friend will tell you that i am empathetic and understanding to everyone in my life too.  conflicts at work do not qualify as abusive behavior.  i am sorry to say but when you are working in an environment with children with challenging behavior, emotions can run very high.  we respect each other at work, we may have conflicts, we may agree to disagree but we all care very much about each other.  where did you get that i felt proud about improving my financial investments by voting for trump?  i never, ever used the word proud.  why are you so interested in what my mother would have to say about my morality?  she raised me and toled me that she would always love me.@ again, how in the hell does a person turn their values on and off.  i am who i am wherever i am.   my values and core beliefs do not change.  my goodness, talk about assumptions.   you dont know me.  you were reading some conversations that were posted last night that became some what tongue in cheek.  do you know what that means?  do you know what it means to have a dry sense of humor?  nobody was mean or attacking last night.  everyone was civil and respectful, even if they did not at all agree with my vote.  you should change your user name to unqualified, unstable, and not in any position to give relationship advice because i dont have any.@ when did i mention my abuse?  i said that i was treated in a way growing up that i decided not to treat my children.  you said that i mentioned that because i like to argue?  again, another assumption you made.  i dont like to argue and i dont like conflict.  and anyone who has had trauma in their past, no matter how significant doesnt just throw it in there to argue.  trauma is real.  trauma hurts.  nobody likes to talk about and relive trauma.  you think that i am lying about my past?  my goodness, you have no idea.  i live my truth.  i am an honest person.  honesty is one of the values that i uphold the most in my relationships.  that is why i did not lie about who i voted for.  i have a feeling that if you work, it is in a lab with no people and you go home not talking to any real people then you sit at home without any people and respond to peoples questions on reddit.  you are not in anyway qualified, worthy, or stable enough to be giving anyone relationship advice when you dont have any relationships.@ how in the world do you fake and turn empathy on and off?  how does someone do that? you said that i happily acknowledged what i did? doesnt my post say that i felt sad, upset, and bereft yesterday?  where does it say that i felt happy?  again, you are making an assumption.  you never answered the question about your supposed best friend who is a social worker.  what kind of social work does she do?   what degree does she have?  so you never get mad and have arguments with people?  you are always 100% nice?  if so, i have to ask, how deep and authentic are your relationships?  do you even have relationships with people?  with your family?  with a significant other?  oh thats right you are divorced and unwilling to date again.  i get it you are jealous of me and my life.  i have a happy marriage, two wonderful self sufficient adult children, and an absolutely amazingly smart and beautiful grandchild.  my life is good and my heart is full.  obviously, yours is not.  i feel sorry for you.  i am sorry that you are so unhappy.  my post was from last night.  a lot changes and happens in 24 hours.@ i think you should be fired from your job for all of the false assumptions you make.  wait, you probably dont have a job that is why you voted for biden.@ also, i dont know what the fuck ta means.  yes, i used the word fuck.  should i be fired for swearing outside of work too?  i am sipping a hard cider and watching dumb reality tv should i be fired from my job for that as well?  i will spend tomorrow, a holiday writing reports and working.  should i be fired for that too?  who the fuck are you and where did you come from?  please go away.@ also, i dont know what the fuck ta means.  yes, i used the word fuck.  should i be fired for swearing outside of work too?  i am sipping a hard cider and watching dumb reality tv should i be fired from my job for that as well?  i will spend tomorrow, a holiday writing reports and working.  should i be fired for that too?  who the fuck are you and where did you come from?  please go away.@ i really need positivity in my life right now and you are very negative.  you misconstrue my words, take them out of context and then misquote me manipulating my words.  i never used the word abuse.  everyone gets mad and most people have had some type of disagreement with their colleagues at work.  you are way exaggerating what i said by saying that i abuse my colleagues.  if i do then how come they are they some of my best friends who i spend time with outside of work.  i said that i displaced my anger yesterday.  obviously, it was very mild because my colleague said she did not think twice about it.  how did having a minor slip up of being 100% nice all of the time become abuse?  are you insane?  you made a huge, giant leap there.  you also said i was proud of my choice because of financial investments.  would i have written this post if i felt proud.  again, you took a huge giant leap with what i said.  it is obvious that you dont spend that much time around people who are different than you or may have a different perspective or opinion.  opinions are like assholes and everyone has one.  i am not going to dismiss a person, call them names, and tell them that they should be fired from their job because of assumptions you are making about me.   you are very judgmental and you have made a lot of assumptions.  you say that you have worked in the field of science so you are always looking for assumptions.  you have made so so many false assumptions and accusations about me.  you really are a sad and a pathetic person.  really, you are quite toxic and not anybody that i would want to be associated with or even converse with.  you really need to gain some introspection and insight into your own behavior and actions and why you are so angry and hateful and attacking me.  i asked for constructive feedback trying to be as open and honest as i could be in the thread.  i dont know what comments you have read but the conversation between maleficient  elk and i last night became somewhat tongue in cheek,  you are completely misconstruing the content, tone, context, and gist of our conversation.  you do not have a sense of humor, you lack objectivity, you lack empathy, and you are quite judgmental.  you are definitely someone that i do not need or want to give me any feedback regarding my situation.  you are comparing me to a murderer.  i would not even kill a spider.  you have some serious mental health issues and you need some psychiatric help asap.  you need some type of intervention.@ first of all, i cant get fired because i have tenure.  i would have to have a record of write ups and bad evaluations.  i do not have any of those.  in all of my evaluations since the appr was established i have been  rated as highly effective in all of the categories i have been rated.  second, my friends would not use any of the words my mother used to describe me.  believe me, i asked them.  i dont feel good about myself when i lash out at work, i feel horrible and i have to go back and apologize.  however, i am human and i make mistakes, all of the time.  i am very good at my job and i know that i have positive relationships with my students, families, and staff.  i have won an apple for the teacher award and last year i was voted by one of my students as his favorite teacher for all that i did for him over his 3 years at middle school.  i think you took my comments out of context and i dont think that you read the whole thread.@ judged me for my voting choice, not how i do my job, how i am as a mother, a daughter, a sister, a wife, and a grandmother, all of which she has always given me extreme praise for how i fulfill all of those roles.  she is quite proud of me, my children, and my granddaughter.@ no thank you.  i apologized to my co-worker along with my colleagues today.  my young new colleague said that she did not even think twice about what i said,  that she knew i was stressed, and that she was fine with what i said. i then spent the next half an hour teaching her how to do the progress comments on iep direct despite having a lot of my own work to still do.  selfish?   i happen to be very self critical and hard on myself so perhaps i overstated that the interaction was more negative than it was.    when did i say i was proud to improve my personal finances at the cost of other values?  i do not believe i ever used the word proud.   i have a pattern of becoming increasingly more high strung as my stress level increases.  that is how i am wired.  what kind of social work does your best friend do?  i am sure that she has an entirely different temperament than i do, and that is okay.  i would like to hear your definition of a social worker because i honestly dont think you have a clue.  your best friend is probably a caseworker that only has her bachelors degree, not a social worker with a masters degree.  also, i dont think a long term marriage can sustain having a partner who is not empathetic.@ thank you.  i will check it out.  i appreciate your straight forward approach to trying to help me understand the financial aspects of the election.  yes, you are right i probably should have done my own research but i relied on our financial advisor as well as a friend whose husband is also a financial advisor.  both supporters of trump, not as a person and his stand on many issues but for fiscal reasons.@ i guess i should have lied to my mother and to the reddit readers and said that i voted for biden.  would that me be more moral, empathetic, and  intelligent ?  would that demonstrate that i am less materialistic and selfish?@ also, do you know anything about moral development and how we acquire it?  what about empathy and how we acquire it?  i have never made decisions based on money but i dont think it is immoral for me not to want my hard earned savings to disappear.@ i honestly do not know how anyone can be a social worker and lack empathy.    do you even know what a social worker does?  i have an over abundance of empathy.  also, you cannot tell me what you think this election was about.  that it was about morality is your perception and interpretation, not mine.@ i definitely posted on the wrong site.  at least the people who commented last night were a lot nicer and more understanding than those who posted today.  i guess i also should have done my research about the reddit audience.  clearly proving once again that i am unintelligent.@ after 29 years as a successful school social worker you think i should be fired for my voting choice?  are you kidding me?!?  do you know anything about being a social worker and how hard we work for very little pay?  frankly, your response is ridiculous and callous.@ thank you.  i am glad that things worked out well for you.  i am sure they will work out with my mother too.@ and i lack empathy?  really?@ wow, and you all are saying that i lack empathy, really?  the hard left seems to stand for hate and anger.  i dont see any trump supporters calling out biden supporters with hate and anger.  i am already over it and know that my relationship with my mother will be fine.@ thank you!  finally someone who focused on economics in the election.  not sure where i would have researched that information ahead of time?@ clearly i am unintelligent, selfish, materialistic, and i lack empathy.  hence, my choice to vote for trump.  please read the whole thread and my reasons for voting for him.  however, you will not understand and i am pretty sure this post will be my first and last on reddit.@ if you read the whole thread i either changed the subject when my parents brought up politics, agreed with their stance, and/or said that i did not want to talk about it and told them i was apolitical.@ thank you for your support.  i gleaned the hard left position of reddit last night.  i tried to remain calm and civil but some of the responses are ridiculous.@ yes, you know, we can say things like that it each other because we are family!  @ i did.  she apologized. we have a good working relationship.  she said she feels like i am a sister to her so she feels comfortable acting in a way that is more sisterly towards me.@ the chair of our department said fuck you to me last year when i confronted her about a breech of confidentiality with a student who wrote a letter to her stepmother.  the chair of our department is friends with the students step mother and told her about the letter.  the student then got into trouble.  i told my colleague that i did not think she should have told the stepmother and she responded by saying fuck you.  i was dumbfounded.@ i am not sure why you are stuck on this aspect of my story.  people say a lot of mean things to me at work.  during the first few years i worked in this school the chair of my department made me cry several times.  i already said that i would apologize to her.@ exactly.  thank you so much!  i am glad to hear that someone else is going through something similar to what i am.@ your teacher probably has a lot of work to do that she is mentally agonizing about getting done but she is also trying to be nice to you.  is there a counselor, social worker, or psychologist you can talk to instead during the school day?   as a school social worker when the school day is over i have a lot of other tasks to do and i am usually fried from a full day of interactions with students, staff, and families.  your teacher is just being polite.  she is probably young and eager to please.  help her out by giving her some space to do what she needs to do after school and do your own thing.  hang out with kids your age, join a club, do your homework etc~@ lol! okay, i rambled when i supported every other democratic candidate.  i am sure things will work out.  i appreciate everyones support.  believe it or not, this whole experience has made me feel better.  i have never posted on reddit before.  that is how desperate i was feeling!@ its a dog eat dog world working in middle school. one of my friends said that the staff tends to take on the persona of the age of the students that they work with, so i guess i was acting like a middle schooler.  you have to have thick skin to work with middle school students because they will say all kinds of things to you.  having raised two children i know not to take things personally at work.@ what is just like a trump supporter?  have you ever gotten mad at work?  i try to stay centered and even keeled but the conflict with my mother has been bothering me all day yesterday and today.  i cant seem to get over it or figure out how to let it go.  i have always been eager to please and i dont like it when i make my parents unhappy, even at the ripe old age of 58.  if i knew my mother was going to react his way, i would have voted for biden.@ what do you mean good luck?  biden won new york state and was going to win new york state no matter who i voted for.  it really did not matter.  as a social worker i am glad that biden won.  as a person who has what little nest egg we have invested i am worried about the economic impact of biden in office.  are we going to lose our money?@ no.  she tried to explain herself and what she meant by free time but i talked over her.  it was a google meeting.  two of us are working from home due to medical exemptions because of covid and the other five people who were in the meeting are working in person.  there seems to be a bit of a divide between us and our modality of work but that dynamic has been improving.   the meeting happens weekly and it is comprised of guidance and administration.  the new staff person is younger than my children, fresh out of graduate school and she has needed a lot of help which i have given her.  i have answered countless questions for her and  i have shown her how to do several tasks, and i am not even her mentor who gets paid to mentor her.@ i agree!  drinking is always involved when i get together with my family which has been a long time because of covid.@ i know.  she was an easy target.  the chair of the special education department rolled her eyes at me.@ especially this year.  do you and your mother agree about politics?@ thank you for your support.  i told my kids that i would never, ever do that to them about who they voted for.  there are a lot of things that i did not do to my children that were done to me growing up.@ i am not and never was a trump supporter. i was a biden supporter.  i made up my mind on election day after talking to a few friends and taking a quiz.  my answers to the quiz actually indicated that i should vote for biden.  i never publicly discussed politics nor posted about it on facebook.  i live in a very liberal town in the blue state of new york.  hence, another reason why i knew my vote wouldnt really count.  biden was going to win new york anyway.  perhaps i should have written in kanye?@ lol!  thank you for making me laugh!  i needed that tonight.@ lol!  okay.  i can be mean at work.  it is something i have been trying to work on.  i get my meaness from my mother.@ what are the selfish reasons to vote for trump as a school social worker for 29 years who has a masters degree and i am finally, after all of these years, making somewhat of a decent salary?  if i were in business with a 63 credit masters degree i would be making a six figure income.  lets also take into consideration the fact that i am married, for 33 years to a retired union carpenter who earns a small pension.  selfish?  materialistic?  lacking in intelligence?  lacking in empathy?  please explain to me why?@ yes, and i am a registered democrat.  please see my comments below about my reasoning or you can be like my mom and hang up on me.@ yes, when i called her and asked her how long she was going to be mad at me she said that she does not hold a grudge.  i told her that wasnt true because she did not speak to her brother for weeks, perhaps months over politics.@ i think i need some space first.  my mother really hurt my feelings.  the young employe said that she had some free time at work.  i was mad because i have been working long days with no breaks or lunch and i dont have any free time.  i have 28 kids on my caseload and she has 5, in addition to all of our evaluations and the paperwork required for special education meetings.  i am still kind of angry about the imbalance of caseloads.  about 4 weeks into school i asked her if she could take one more student who i was having a hard time scheduling and she said no.  i was somewhat incredulous that a brand new employee would say no.  i have a hard time saying no to anything at work and i have been there a long, long time.@ you are very perceptive.  no thanks in helping me with my relationship with my mother because you are in complete agreement with her regarding trump?@ trump, for economic reasons.  selfish? perhaps but for the first time in our lives my husband and i finally have some discretionary income and we are not living pay check to pay check with credit card debt.  we helped put our two children through college but they both still have student loans.  our taxes were easier to do this year, we received a sizable amount of money back, and for the first time in a long time we did not have to pay state taxes.  do i like trump as a person?  no.  i cant even listen to him speak.  do i agree with him on issues? no, and i cant stand betsy devos.  my reasoning was purely due to economics.   also, please let me mention that i am as apolitical as they come and cannot stand discussing politics.  i spent 4 years doing my best to avoid the subject with my parents or being supportive of them or just going along with their views.  i did not vote for trump in 2016 but my husband and son did, much to the dismay and anger of my parents, particularly my mother who was a politics major in college.  she said that if her husband voted for trump she would divorce him.  when i asked her what the effect of having biden in office would have on our financial situation she said that she did not know, that she got a d in economics, and that they do not have stocks anymore.  my husband, who is a retired union carpenter has his annuity invested.  my parents had quite a lot of stocks but sold them all when the market crashed in 2008.  i am not sure what year it crashed but around that time.  prior to that with the money they had invested my father claimed to be a millionaire.  they live in a gated community and have had a bmw, a porsche, and a fiat and i am materialistic.  i have only owned used cars with the exception of one brand new car many years ago before children.  i am also not sure how i have had a successful career as a school social worker for 29 years if i lack empathy.@ this situation sounds very similar to my own (f58) however, after hearing that my parents (f83, m82). told my adult daughter (f31) that they were very disappointed in her for who she voted for i was very angry.  i called my mother and told her i voted for the same person and started to explain why.  my mother hung up on me.   i called back and did some more rationalizing of why i voted for this particular candidate in an escalated voice and hung up on her.  i called her the next day to try to patch things up.  she said that she still loves me but she doesnt know if she can ever forgive me because of who i voted for.\n",
      "i was driving a 2013 g37x with my mom in the car a few months ago. we were at a 4 way stop and started to go given our time. an older lady in a prius flew by going perpendicular for us. i strongly believe without my quick reaction and abs we wouldve been dead@ this was a fair fight statwise. the other play has a stronger synergy and better gear scores but neither of those are taken into account during matchmaking@ i read it first as i lied about time to pandemic make a response profit to give gop from it. senators and my family because im an idiot@ thank you, and i am grateful to those who care to listen to me. the reality of our situation as a country is that while both sides feel like the other wants to rip apart their entire lives for small gains, we need to learn to respect eachother again. we cant treat eachother like the enemy anymore. its one of the many reasons i cant stand people who put shit like if you voted for trump or third party, please block me on everything. imo people like that are just as bad as those who cant accept the election results in terms of divisiveness. divided we fall and united we stand@ yankee with no brim@ im still mad we didnt get buttigieg as atleast vice president or even a cabinet position tbh@ no theyre completely right. i dont know how to tell you this but half the country isnt simply evil or completely ducking stupid. do i agree with some of their beliefs? no. would i have ever voted for trump? hell no. do i understand why some of my friends voted for him/supported him even if i didnt agree with it? yea, i do@ physicareaper-ame comi catwoman like llamathrustulti-regime black adam@ rba good tho@ im dtill on season 4 of ng but when does la forge get a beard?!@ pro pack (400 nth)@ yessir! just need to pull boss grundy from the challenge pack three times in a row first and then completely swear the pack off@ pro pack (400 nth)@ lmao i did right after i promise@ thank you!!@ thank you!!!@ im so sorry i didnt mean to accuse you of that! i just meant shes a very insane person. her entire twitter is batshit crazy tbh@ transformed wife is lowkey just easy karma for posting here@ mexicanese*@ only thing i want to add is im not sure if you will be able to find a 9th gen at that price, even high mileage@ i just put it under try to be funny. this is a somewhat known fake post a conservative made a while back to make liberals look bad. the person who made it and this person are both fucking disgusting for reposting this@ ben garrison is fuming@ i completely agree. this is fucking disgusting, im just not sure what to report it under. op is also downvoting everyone lol@ which robin do you plan on doing?@ get past what exactly? if youre talking about the effects of his presidency, we will feel those effects for a very long time. there is no getting past that. if youre talking about people not posting about it anymore, you trying to censor his name is not going to make people post about it less@ jokes funny and shit but why is trump blurred lol@ i was actually gonna comment the same thing the other guy did but you cleared it for me lol ty@ this was funny the first 5 times i saw it, but at this point yall are really just kicking a dead horse@ ooooo sounds cool!@ completely disagree. his stats may be shit, but his passive can be devastating if used right. i use him on one of my mp teams@ rba is fucking awesome tho@ awesome concept! just voted and curious, who is grid? dont remember him in the injustice games@ bro ive gotten boss grundy three times. containment is actually decent at being a tank and moreso he always sounds like a fun character to use@ yo i totally understand and agree with these rules but i gotta say im pretty sure this was the plot to footloose@ batman prime: some basic damage gears, basically all the crit/basic damage stuff i didnt give to flashpoint lord joker: some sp2 stuff regime black adam: two health gears and the fire companion card@ hope you get your platinum my guy@ just posted it to r/donaldtrump. lets see how long it takes me to get banned lol  edit: it got removed but i almost hit 10 upvotes before someone realized something!@ went to a carmax (yeah i know that part alone shouldve been a red flag but o well) with my dad like 20 miles away to look at some jettas after my 2004 pilot died because the the carmax near our house didnt have any and the carmax far away managed to sweet talk us a little bit. got into the first one (just an automatic base model, nothing special) and it looked alright. our salesperson (who was in his 70-80s) talked non stop about how brilliant sporty and all that other crap the jetta was. i took the right out of the parking lot with it, put my foot down and the car barely moved. i floored it and nothing changed. at that point i noticed a check engine light quickly pulled over to the side as the salesman claimed he made a mistake and took a car from the repair for a customer pile. whatever, people make mistakes and we came to see cars. i jumped into a manual jetta next. popped the clutch all the way in and could not move the lever an inch. the guy claimed he made another mistake and my dad and i decided this wasnt the dealership for us. on the bright side, on the way home we found the best jamaican food wed ever had@ could be worse but this is why everyone opens 400/800 packs instead. hope you have better luck next time my guy@ holocosplayers is a term that ive never seen before and am sad to have to add to my vocabulary@ deadass, i didnt realize that until you commented @ judging by our 250k deaths ill say we passed it a while ago@ i would agree with my car@ ill argue that rba is better than regime ww, and moreso id even call him a good character. his stats are shit, no ones disputing that. but if you utilize his passive properly he becomes a monster. i use him on my mp team to great success, he lets me melt through every metal but catwoman, and is able to stall her claws out@ yea but ive always preferred a knob@ what do you think the exhaust is for @ lmao all good, just wanted to let you know@ totally agree rittenhouse is a murderer but i do want to point out that theyre cleaning the vandalism in the picture not vandalizing more@ getting top 5% isnt actually that hard if you play a consistent amount every day. i find that i reach top 3% simply by doing the 5 battles with my two mp teams every day just once (i get an average of 3,200 per battle)@ fly like the logo on my cousins 440@ as a car enthusiast i can promise that the majority of us are glad to have him@ huh, i use a similar team on mp (bats prime, lord joker and rba). im assuming bats and quinn are for support and jokers your main hitter?@ nice@ all good mate, just wanted to make sure@ i was gonna ask who she was but honestly ive decided i really dont want to know@ i know the joke is that youre super close to buying a 200 pack but if youre intending to do so please dont. getting a 400 pack will always be better@ i forgot which one but one of the hawk girls reduces tag in cool down which helps you take advantage of banes passive. nightwing works great with bane so i wouldnt change him. if you happen to have cc batgirl/tbwl those are also good alternatives@ totally agree, but i always saw the wrx and gli as counterparts to the si@ i mean the gli is only like a couple grand more than the si new, same with the wrx. i dont think thats enough of a difference@ ah that makes sense and i just want to say i freaking love you guys and your show!!!@ interesting they picked an accord over an si@ damn straight@ its a dodge challenger@ i loved you as m in the daniel craig james bonds@ some people in an effort to occasionally censor words or be more inclusive. my gripe is that theyre censoring dumb shit and its not censoring if you can tell what the word is@ with what part?@ yea but ive mainly noticed this through texts or discord. not as often through social media. what youre saying may be true@ i think the thought is that because it doesnt specify a gender, its not excluding other ones@ may i assume you are latino/latina? and just curious, why dont you like it?@ i 100% agree. ill be honest, this was inspired by a conversation i just had where the other person used germxny instead of germany. she could not give me a satisfactory answer to why, so im hoping someone else can@ bane is the word drop from the gold pack. while rba lacks strong stats, when used properly his passive can be devastating. i only hope i can get astro harness soon for him@ yea i got to strongly disagree with this. i actually use him on one of my mp teams with batman prime and lord joker (weird combo ik) and he honestly lets me melt through every metal but catwoman. and even then his passive helps me stall her hits so i can tag in lord to finish her off without risking drain. knowing when to tag him in has genuinely saved me so many times. i strongly believe he is the most underrated card in the game@ thank you will keep in mind!@ rear wheels* /s  looks awesome my guy! wh-t strips did buy? im looking to do the same mysled@ i got metal catwoman lol@ people voted for hawkins who werent part of their immediate family?@ top of the holy totem@ congratulations man!@ e@ please stop reposting this i swear this is like the 8th time ive seen it@ paom, search up because the internet shirt. its like 70$ tho just a heads up@ dont disagree but this probably belongs on a different sub tbh. just because the word dick is in there doesnt automatically make this humor. im sure r/politics or something would love this@ nah fuck that, while trump definitely needs to be in jail, so does lori@ eh, hes aight in my opinion. if youre new, hell definitely help. why do you ask?@ i genuinely dont know whether youre messing with me or not but god damn@ what is the shark attack?@ i was about to buy! what else you using for the costume?@ ww should lowkey be at the top too. her passive is devastating when used right@ 100% agree. luckily, unlike this post him being an asshole is quite a popular opinion@ .@ would you believe me if i said i already tried that?@ im deathly allergic to peanuts, that could be a snickers and id still eat that shit@ she doesnt need that much, plus i already paid a staggering 750$ in taxes and its just too much for this year@ ill let you know, i have some of the biggest hands anyones ever seen! my daughter says my hands are so big, so big all the time@ ah, thank you! didnt recognize her@ forgive me, whos the top middle?@ i read that first line and got really nervous for a second@ i totally agree but please post this to an appropriate sub. there isnt anything inherently humorous about this post, a sub like r/politics would suit this better@ i love my fb6 so fucking much but it makes me so angry that i dont have a volume knob@ honestly im just surprised people so stupid have read dune@ i fucking snorted water out of my nose when i found trudeau@ sorry about your situation my guy, just read the scrolling thingy. hope shit gets better@ id argue to replace bats with insurgency bats. insurgency is just ass and prime has his uses@ could be better, could be worse@ lmao my asian dad just stared at me for like 20 minutes. didnt help i bought like 150$ worth of pokmon cards today too@ if i buy the pack i can get him from pz tho right?@ based, my sibling@ funny but posting fake tweets is not really the move imo@ id love to try whatever youre smoking my guy@ r/rareinsults@ and the shirt from the bti cover@ nice, and repost when you reach 69420 please@ bro i feel you. before i bought my si i had an 04 my parents gave to me. we bought it new, and had it up til last year when the transmission blew at 306k miles. i honestly cried for days after, i loved that car@ hint: re arrange the letters into the word ginger to make a new word starting with n and ending with r@ youre 100% correct. i made a fallacy by assuming op was in such a situation@ youre 100% right. i worded my comment poorly, rather i shouldve said if op was in such a situation i hope it get better for her. genuinely, thank you for your reply@ on a different note, i dont know you or your situation but im somewhat aware of the circumstances that would force someone to have an abortion and the ramifications and i truly hope life gets better for you. im sorry you have to go through with this  edit: i apologize op. i shouldnt assume you are in a position where you are forced to have an abortion and i do believe there are other valid reasons for having an abortion. my well wishes for you still stands@ not that i think hes going to do it for so many reasons but because im sure someone else will bring it up its only been 4 years@ dude honestly if a dealership isnt doing what theyre contractually obligated to, youre probably heading for a battle. also with recent events i can firmly say i can agree with you on one point: fuck dealerships@ ill be honest i dont know much but i think you should also cross post this to r/legaladvice@ on a different note im pretty sure youtube was still a massive thing in 2016  source: im atleast 4 years old@ cross post this to r/antimlm lol. theyll think its ducking hilarious@ lmao im sorry i gotta argue on this i unironically think hes better than bn dooms. i actually run him on my more famous mp team (its quite unique, lord joker, batman prime and rba) and half the time he ends up being my best damage dealer. using/gearing him right lets you absolutely melt through metals tbh. im not new to the game by any means (i mean i wouldnt call myself a top tier player or anything but i do know how to play decently). i strongly suggest if you havent ever seriously used him before to try him out. use health gears on him and switch him in on characters with hard sp1s (like metal shazzy) and watch him work his magic@ nah you had the audacity to put rba at the lowest rank. hes fucking awesome, easily deserves hard@ lmao ill be honest i didnt even see the rest i just looked for rba because hes my favorite character @ thats true, i think ill try and chill a bit more from now on. ty mate@ just not trying to get into useless arguments man, you feel?@ personally i believe rba was done dirty here. hes honestly really good if you use him right, i use him on my mp team and glad the time hes my greatest damage dealer. i think he should be in great easily@ in case it comes up, i dont like trump but i dont like people making up dumb shit like this either lol@ i wouldve completely missed that if it wasnt for you@ i know this probably sounds like common sense but dont attempt to lighten the mood with a joke. i promise you it wont end well@ o please dont get me wrong the idea of all these bastards getting voted out makes me giddy too. but this is pretty much spam and id like to point it out. if it doesnt belong in this sub,  dont post it here. there are tons of places to post this, any other sub where you posted something that didnt belong it would get taken down pretty fast  edit: to put it simply mate, the idea of this made us both happy yes? but was that happiness given to us by something humorous or just having a slightly less corrupt government again?@ dude the lack of self awareness on your part is astounding my guy@ i would absolutely love it too, but please post this to the appropriate sub. r/politics would probably be a decent place. this is r/politicalhumor, where your posts have to be both political and humorous in nature. simply the idea that these three could be voted out does not count as humor@ aye i only have good things to say about her! thank you so much! i completely agree!@ totally agree! thank you!@ meme was funny but your caption isnt. polyamory is totally legitimate and shouldnt be frowned upon in a consensual relationship@ yea. not my favorite but youll find a good chunk of this sub loves her@ yall are getting metals?@ seconded@ fp is aight by himself. fp is godly with an fp team. inj2 is damn good no matter what@ yea its weird but honestly i cant stand for all this bruce wayne slander. dude im numerous comics has been shown to be the epitome of what a billionaire should be like@ alternatively:  1. fuck 2. you 3. with 4. a bad dragon dildo covered in sandpaper@ im so sorry to hear that. i hope shes doing better and has tried therapy@ i can tell you from experience unfortunately that some women see it as a negotiation with men too. i wholeheartedly agree with that third part.@ youre probably 100% correct. im sorry, tbh i havent slept a lot recently and ive made a few dumb blunders today anyways@ applies to sex too@ ww is damn good, using her passive with her sp2 correctly lets me run through entire teams on the second challenge level every time. i use her instead of nightwing@ mega fucking based@ no hes fucking fantastic!@ damn, i only wanna buy it if it has the screenplay@ it was staged at the beginning. he literally took out the real box right after and opened that@ dude it was staged at the beginning. he took out the real box after the joke and kept it safe and opened it very carefully. lmao watch the vid before you shit on him, aint right to shit on someone without doing your due diligence@ bro rays tweet is real. the tweet responding to that (the one right under) is not. i asserted that the response (again the tweet right under by nascar) is fake. the link you gave does not corroborate the narrative that the reply from nascar is real. just a heads up, maybe im wrong and you sent the wrong link by accident. but if not, i would advise you to use google.com (a great website that can answer all sorts of questions) before you make yourself look like an idiot lol@ unfortunately i believe the reply is fake but its still funny@ imo stands for in my opinion. hope what i said helps!@ i mean you cant really promote ares until his no season so hes out. hal isnt that great. raven tt is a great character to focus on no matter what. imo raven prime is a fantastic character but if youre looking for your first gold to work on id probably go with someone else. flash is one of the 4 best silvers in the game, youll need to keep promoting him for challenges. dead shot is the best character imo for you to focus on. hes easy to use, is good by himself and can be a powerhouse. just my bit, please pay heed to the more experienced players@ would you extend the time limit or just make it so once she hits 40% her passive activates for an indefinite amount of time until she tags out?@ eh, not by much imo but i do agree@ oh god thats so much worse im sorry my guy@ caught in a landslide, no escape to reality@ the worst part is i dont even know if this is a real quote but if someone replied and said it was i would 100% believe them@ yo i swear its just allergies my eyes sweating mad@ how the fuck@ bnj bats is a tough motherfucker, no ones disputing that. but let fp bats breathe and hell tear through your team like a flaming chainsaw cutting through warm butter@ aqua man is a wannabe rba imo and fp deathstroke needs to be paired with the other two to be devastating. batman is terrifying by himself, and even worse when on his fp team@ it was! honestly id kill to get the liquids youre talking about but i dont know anyone who sells them@ yea man, theyre cool as fuck@ free, testing it for my friend. not legal here, but it was decriminalized@ free, my friend made them and i offered to test them@ hey man, im a freshman at college whos stuck at home and has trouble making new friends because of it too. hit me up my guy (or anyone else whos like to be friends) in dms@ put a gun against his head@ congratulations! whatd you drive before?@ whered you buy those?@ bro if i show a cop this maybe they wont shoot me!@ dude that sounds fucking awesome! yea the lime gummy wasnt bad at all. havent had too many edibles in my lifetime honestly, but i had a milky way one that was fantastic@ gummy edible my friend made. another friend already had one yesterday and said it was insane. hasnt hit yet. its lime flavored@ he got covid@ he got it@ he got it@ arkham knight batman seems like hed be fun to play with. i also want nightwing because i hate fighting against him so much he seems to be pretty damn good. ive always wanted inj 2 supes, but through his challenge specifically so i have the option of direct promotion. those and a ton of other characters@ my dad and i have almost every mad magazine made. i know theyve made more digs at him, ill look through and post others i find@ yea honestly im really fucking done with posts like these at this point. dont get me wrong, i dont like/support trump and this sub does have some fantastic posts (like all the debate memes) but shit like this is why this sub has become a joke to so many. i just report posts like these as spam at this point. op if youre reading this, find the right sub to post this stuff on. r/politicalhumor aint it@ i think its great youre voting for biden, but please post this to the appropriate sub. this sub is r/politicalhumor, meant for humorous takes on american politics. simply acknowledging the debate was a shit show without making your statement humorous in some nature is not enough@ regime black adam is much better@ no its because they have a full stack of those characters smh@ i like jill biden. i do not like melania trump. i believe in fairly criticizing those with platforms for legitimate things they have done. what i dont vibe with is shaming people for sex work/modeling. melania has plenty of legitimate things to criticize, go after those@ yea lol tbh before i read the text i just assumed it was a mustang joke lmao@ totally agree. only time ive posted a matchup was to brag about how i won against a team with a much better synergy, perfect gear scores on 3 cards (only gear i had equipped was the goa) and stats much higher. wasnt a hacker, just was proud@ this one is probably fake, ive seen the same thing used for 3 other different looking girls with an onlyfans already@ pretty sure this isnt legal unless there is a sign warning about the 5000 volts. however im not a lawyer. think your neighbor should post this to r/legaladvice or some other lawyer sub to cover their ass. sucks their signs keep getting stolen, hope it doesnt happen to them again@ ofc, glad i could help! totally agree, ive had my civic away from me for almost 2 months (i gave my civic to what i can only assume is the most incompetent honda dealership in all of existence) and its driving me batshit crazy. best part about all this is i have a loaner crv that while i hate everything about (i love honda but holy fucking shit this feels soulless) im sure im gonna feel weird when i finally give it back@ 2004 honda pilot. my parents bought it new, i grew up in it with my little bro. once i got my license (2018) my mom bought a g37x sedan and i got the pilot. despite what most would assume, i fucking loved the car. even now as ive daily driven a performance oriented car and been lucky enough to have the opportunity to drive tons of other seriously fast cars i still stand by the opinion that first gen pilots are seriously fun cars. last august after 306k miles the transmission finally blew to shit. it was a 3k repair for a 500$ car. i cried for days after we gave it to carmax. i knew it would happen eventually and had money saved up to buy my civic and i absolutely love my civic. i just wish i appreciated the car even more when it ran@ this isnt right@ anthony bourdain im pretty sure@ nice.@ aye nice my guy!@ ah, that would be awesome my guy!@ i think its because the kkk being classified as a terrorist organization doesnt make it legally different before. im pretty sure it only matters if its foreign but i could be wrong. otherwise i would assume obama would probably have done that seeing as he has some skin (i know really inappropriate pun) in the game@ weekend cost a kilo@ tbh i dont think the wiki tier list is entirely accurate. that is a great top 3 tho@ lmao you could cross post this to r/politicalcompassmemes the colors are already there@ ive never heard of you tbh but this message makes me think youre a hacker more than anything else?@ i give you that, this is unintentionally funny. i apologize for not seeing you meant it that way, i meant my message to be more for the general audience here rather than you. sorry i think i got a little heated tbh im a little tired of continually seeing nonhumorous or no political posts here and i got more aggressive in this than i realized. no need to apologize, and i love your username btw!@ promotions. i meant levels in terms of the stat range i play in@ free samples?@ drunk driving is fucking disgusting.@ i got a ton of shit for posting this same message on this same sort of post on this same subreddit and im going to do it again regardless:  i believe this to be true for the most part (it is still possible to be mislead by him on other parts). however just because this is something i find true, it doesnt belong on this sub as it lacks humor. this sub is supposed to be for things that are both political and humorous in nature. there are plenty of other subs this is appropriate on and tbh im not sure why content like this isnt regulated here. on any other sub, posting something that doesnt belong would get it taken off, why cant we have the same standards here? just my thoughts, of you disagree feel free to downvote and stuff, but please also reply and explain why you disagree. maybe im wrong, and if so i would want to know and why in order to better myself  disclaimer in case it wasnt clear enough: i am not a trump supporter@ john stewart green lantern is my guess@ earlier today i was bitching because i pulled regime raven from a challenge pack for the first time. after realizing that i use both regime gl and rba on my team im glad i pulled her so i could make a different team for this challenge (im playing online while i wait for recharges)@ nevermind i opened another one and i got a boss grundy my bad luck streak is over woooohoooooooooooooooo@ oh i totally agree its very unlikely. but i just wanted to point out that unlike the e7 metals this is is actually somewhat feasible. ill put it this way: i wont bet anything that this is a hacker, but i also wont bet anything that it isnt@ definitely worth it. arguably one of the best cards in the game and now you can promote him directly. once you put crit augments and gears on him hell beat shit silly@ fair@ i mean this one could be legit. these are all somewhat recent challenges. grinding bb6 and jumping onto online is possible@ bro what gaming chair you using@ you have rba my guy, its more than fair@ yea but i know evolving catwoman/shazzy makes them stupid good@ yes maam/sir (for future reference im a dude lol)@ yessir! 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad. 200 pack bad.@ rip my guy yep can safely say lesson learned@ for what? or you giving me karma@ bn doomsday isnt terrible, lmao im trying to remember what pack but i got him too recently@ eh, tbh i rank him 10th in the batmans personally but to each their own@ lmao i usually buy 400s but i got 200 today and said fuck it why not? guess this is why not@ ah, thank you so much for informing me my guy! seriously appreciate it. please let your friend know i hope he enjoys his next car more than he did this one@ yea that guys a dumbass lmao. ill admit i dont know as much about porsches so not entirely sure if you answered this by saying c2 but is it a turbo, gt2 or gt3?  also why are you selling it? pandemic financial decisions or upgrading?@ what car is it?@ no, but ive read unaccustomed earth and really enjoyed it! ill check namesake out when i finish rereading the dune series!@ i have had flings with caucasian women , although tbh im kinda young so out of all my relationships, only 2 were ever really serious. most were casual, physical only or middle school dating. so please keep that in mind when i talk about my experience, im sure most others here have more.   honestly, its never been about just being in good shape and stuff for me. here are all the things ive found girls in general are just very attracted to  lookswise girls value looks a bit less than guys do. thats not to say danny devito is going to be lucky with everyone, rather you dont have to be timothee chalamet to have a chance. what girls really value is care taken into appearance. for instance, im not the guy who is super anal and meticulous about his hair, combing it every second it goes out of line (my hair is actually incredibly curly and refuses to stay combed for more than 20 minutes. my mom hates it) but i shampoo and condition it every day and make sure its always cut nicely. when it gets overgrown, i wear a baseball cap. i had pretty bad acne for a while but i keep my face clean and occasionally use products. if you saw me now, tbh youd never have known about my acne. while in a perfect world id love to grow my beard out, i find people only find it attractive as stubble so i keep it accordingly. i actually really really really hate spending money on clothes, so i dont really wear anything expensive. i do still dress pretty decently and make sure to rarely buy from places that contribute to fast fashion (ill admit to a few pairs of jeans from h & m but i try to stay as ethical as possible. while not necessarily looks, hygiene is a huge factor. i think thats why a lot of indian guys fail, girls think about the unhygienic stereotypes and stay away. simply put, shower every day, use deodorant, brush your teeth and other shit and youll be fine. as for body shape: i had more trouble with girls when i had abs honestly. it was a mindset i had that honestly made me a massive douchebag. basically, your body doesnt matter as much but i would work out and make your body look like you give a shit about it. whats most important is having a body you like. doesnt matter what anyone else thinks tbh, youre the one who has to live with it  anything other advise im happy to give, just be specific on what elses   edit: almost forgot to add. shave down there. girls dont like hair in their face, that is all@ i mean ive never had any problems interacting with those im attracted to, nor have i found that any race of women is harder to get with than others. ive definitely heard the i dont date brown guys line before but it wasnt directed to me. side note, i think having the mindset of i dont date (certain group of people) is fucking stupid for a myriad of reasons and i probably wouldnt be attracted to the person to begin with@ hell yes, id do it for 100$ honestly@ divorce and cut off completely@ probably half a pound@ well done, no more no less@ hell yes!@ whats the most infuriating parent interaction youve had?@ northern virginia, where i live, there is. the county we live in has been dubbed the internet capital of the world. hence people heavily interested in it positions move here  not at all. i think the experiences and perspectives ive been lucky enough to have wouldnt have been possible if i was somewhere filled with even more indians. it would just be a different culture and im very happy with the one i had growing up@ dad works in cyber security (loves his job) and my mom is an interior designer as well as a graphics designer on the side, a cake designer for fun and is currently writing a book  funny thing: i actually hate indian food. love spicy foods but ive just never been a fan of the flavor and textures of indian food for the most part. if i did have to pick indian foods i do enjoy eating, it comes down to two different things  frankies: basically a paratha (think tortilla but much better) with an omelette on top, what can almost be described as a goat curry on top of that, chopped onions and a special spice on top made into a burrito. its fantastic and one of my few comfort foods. that being said, imo my mom is the only one who makes it good, everyone elses tastes like shit (i am a teensy but biased tho)  chaats: chaat basically translates to street food snack so its a pretty wide variety of things. from chaats, i really enjoy sev puri and dahi puri (id describe them but i think id definitely fuck it up)  i live in virginia@ i think i know the type of screenshots youre talking about. thats definitely a mentality that exists here but for the most part i actually dont even have that many indian friends so i wouldnt be the best person to get information on this from. ive only been in a relationship with one indian girl and while it lasted a while it ended really poorly. since ive never pursued an indian girl (the girl from before pursued me) i wouldnt know from that end but ive never been treated badly by an indian girl/woman for no reason@ thanks man, i wholeheartedly agree! i do, but not during the pandemic (barring a few times back in march where i admittedly didnt take covid as seriously as i should and a couple small parties where i knew everyone had been safe). im in college rn, but im online atm. totally will check out edc for next year my guy, thanks for the recommendation!@ lmao all good my guy@ are you asking me about italian or indian? ill answer both lol  im not italian but if a stereotype is being used in a derogatory manner i will call the user out on that. i have no tolerance for racism of any kind  indian stereotypes for the most part piss me the fuck off. i dont think i need to explain how all the bad ones suck (terrorists, always smell like curry (side note i dont even like indian food lol so its funny whenever people try to say that because i rarely eat it) etc) but even the good ones are kinda shit. i remember when i was trying out for a different club swim team and was put in the bad lane despite recommendations from my old coach as well as recent times showing i was pretty damn good. the reason (which got back to me much later as the coach who put me in the lane fucked up by telling his kid who was my friend) was that i was brown and was obviously just there to pad my resume so i could go to an ivy and therefore wasnt really going to take it seriously@ 18  a ton of things! im super into cars (i drive a 2015 honda civic si sedan in orange pearl thats currently being held hostage by a dealership for electrical work) so i go to a lot of car meets and other enthusiast related things. i love watching (and playing if im not injured) football, i love to swim (did it competitively for 13 years before an injury), work out, watch movies and tv shows (im as obsessed as one can be with star wars, just got into star trek and watching it with my dad, love got still pissed about the ending, watching all the bond movies with my little bro, love horror movies and a ton of other things i dont have time to mention lol), i love to read (currently rereading the dune series cuz the movies coming out soon), love playing video games but i dont do that too often anymore besides occasionally getting bullied by russian 12 year olds on csgo, like to hike, like to cook and learning more about it and honestly just a ton of different things i dont think ill ever have the time to completely list  edit: also love listening to music, really into classic rock, prog, grunge, alt rock and some current rappers. all time favorites are ac/dc and childish gambino   my parents are definitely not conservative in parenting. while im not getting away with murder, i definitely have the opportunity to do things most indian kids dont here. i can basically sum it up with my parents policy on getting drunk at high school parties: they dont want me to ever get drunk but they will never get mad at me if i do so i dont ever have to feel like i cant call them to pick me up if im not good to drive. my parents are honestly fucking awesome, i love them to death@ im deeply atheist despite my parents being kinda muslim. while my grandparents are very religious, my parents have never been. we all drink, dont really go to church on anything. for my parents, its more of a belief in a higher power than anything   funny story: when i was a baby my mom used to speak a myriad of indian languages to me in hopes i would pick it up and be multilingual. it succeeded and grossly backfired at the same time. on one hand, i can for the most part fluently understand hindi, urdu, gujarati, bits of tamil, a teensy bit of marathi and a few other languages as well as respond if done as an instinctual reflex. the problem being with being taught so many languages is to date i cant differentiate between any of them. i also never really responded in anything but english as a kid. if you asked me to say something in one of those languages id either be lost or some weird frankenstein would come out of my mouth. so can i speak hindi? kinda lol. and if its relevant  i cannot read/write in any of those languages  fuck, really hitting the hard questions at me mate. uhhhhhhh pokemon, avatar, regular show, kids next door, old tom and jerry and a thousand other shows im forgetting@ nope, not any meaner than they would be to others. you didnt say anything wrong, but i am curious to why you asked this?@ so the caste system to my understanding is something more important to hindus (im an atheist brought up by very non strict muslim parents). your position in the caste varies among a number of things, like socio economic status and religion. its more important to the older generations than younger kids. simply put, its an outdated system rich people used to divide and discriminate those below them. indian kids do tend to separate into cliques, but its from more of a socio economic class and isnt really intentional. its more that families tend to interact with those in the same status, therefore their kids form deeper relationships with eachother so forth and so on  in some cases it is straight racism and classism taught from the parents, those kids are shit bags@ harry is shown to be unobservant at times during the series. simply put, he never thought of it@ how do you feel about the fact you havent? do you ever feel like youre missing out?@ why do they always do tiffany so dirty?@ not saying this guy is a hacker, looks legit. just thought that stat wise this was a harder matchup@ regime black adam. hands down the most underrated card in the game@ lowkey i think i could beat a much stronger ak bats using rba if given a chance. faced a 20k/29k today with my other mp team that if given the chance i could have beaten with my 10k/18k rba alone@ nah lmao ford stopped making cars because all their cars kinda sucked compared to the competition. civics and accord destroy in pretty much every way. the way i look at manufacturers making copious amounts of cuvs and suvs is that they use those to fund the fun cars that we love. i may not ever want to buy one but ill always respect companies for making smart business decisions yet still managing to appeal to its fanbase  id have a problem if honda was like mitsubishi, where they killed anything cool they made in turn for only making cuvs and suvs. mit basically sold its soul for a few extra bucks. honda would never do that. honda continues to be the best fwd company by leaps and bounds  even ford is doing the right thing. but cutting out cars that dont sell, they keep their company alive. they still make the mustang (and maybe if everyone is really cool for a few years we can get the cool focuses again) and continue to improve on it thereby keeping the soul of their company while being financially responsible@ i only have 1 car but for some reason when non car people see my car they just dont believe its a civic. its led to some of the most infuriating conversations ive ever had@ i mean the rdx is acura so in that case include the mdx too bam 7@ regime black adam because im totally not a fanboy@ any team can be solid depending on how you use it. on my main mp team, i use batman prime and regime black adam (two cards people consider subpar). i have a fantastic win rate with them (check out my character feature series). on a base level, i have to say no just because you havent given enough information. depending on your gear, your strat and other stuff it could be devastating or it could be utter trash@ 100% agree. i dont disagree with this message but its annoying to see posts that arent both political or humorous all the time@ aye its chill, now you know my guy. no hard feelings@ bro that aint the move. switching time is considered cheating and at the least i know even discussing it is a pretty big no no. plus there really isnt even a point@ why not prime instead of blackest?@ so if you see my hand under the table dont bother me!@ maybe like shoes did?@ youre not wrong at all, dont know why youre being downvoted. if you mentioned a politician or something as why then it can stay. hell if your caption was atleast political it would be fine. this is pretty much r/boomerahumor@ hell yes youre right on that@ not entirely so. using a super move fixes it too@ i got 3005 in the left bracket and this is america on the right. who wants to break the tie for me?@ thats iphone?! hows you do it?@ the other two are great but insurgency is lowkey ass. if youre making a serious team arkham origins is decent enough to replace with@ nice! what mods?@ lotta nth metal. whats your strategy?@ true. whatre your favorite cars to drive in that case@ it doesnt@ what car do you drive?@ girls are really really really pretty. if you forget words sometimes, it happens@ personally i put regime at 1st or 2nd. i find that timing his tag ins can be hard, but if you do it right hes downright devastating. ive taken down entire teams of metals just thanks to him and batman prime doing cleanup@ regime, although some could even argue hes the best@ regime, although some could even argue hes the best@ 3rd best black adam, but still usable@ for no reward but bragging rights id hope no ones doing that. ill see if i can figure out another way to do this tho@ you could but from what ive heard it sounds like a ton of effort for bragging rights@ same color and its a sedan. tbh i always see this gen in one or the other, not both. what mods have you done?@ nice! got the exact same car@ i have the same opinion of her as bnj catwoman (atleast bnj at lower levels). she can be damn overpowered, but if you can create even a half decent strategy and just think about what youre doing shes not a really that big of a threat to be against. if youre using her, she requires a little thought but thats about it@ seeing the pack im going to guess ao death stroke or arkham hq. however being stupidly optimistic im also hoping for ak batman since hes on the cover of the pack@ im totally aware. people have been asking for their robin counterparts for a while (which arent in the game). im aware dick already has three cards, but two of them are pretty shit in the current meta and one is a metal. i think another gold version of him wouldnt hurt, especially if it could be made to be somewhat viable. im aware akak is todd, but a prime version would be pretty cool. drake may be a support card, but it doesnt do him justice imo. would love to see a red robin card (maybe as a silver tho, dont think hes gold worthy). damian may be in the game as nightwing, but id love to see a prime version of him as robin as either a really good bronze or a companion card with a special boost to batman or dick grayson nightwing cards@ theyre old, but i think it would be really interesting to see how new bronze cards could effect the meta@ totally agree, shouldve specified i meant we needed a prime version of todd@  nice, he was my first pull out of a 400 (next two were ss hq and reb raven)@ for my fellow americans (and liberians) thats 99.2 pounds@ ive never seen a post so worthy of an award. if i were a richer man i would give you gold@ idk, watched the first season with my family and it was just aight@ actually i did take the chem subject test, and got a 720 (not perfect but could have been worse tbh). ill be honest i completely forgot about subject tests @ bro dont even think of comparing picard to trump. i wont stand for such slander@ hes not even hacking good cards. like atleast put one e7 metal on your team or else youre not really hacking my guy @ alright, thank you will keep in mind!@ ill agree my paranoia may not make sense, hence why i asked@ havent been back to physically check the odometer but i do have proof of what it was before. how many miles should i expect to be added if theyve been 100% truthful?@ there isnt a science section on the sat  -source, i took the sat@ nice. how far does the power distribution change go? can you go 100% 2wd?@ interesting, thanks!@ you drive one?@ thank you for giving me a laugh today, genuinely needed it mate@ dumb question but how do you make money off having foster kids?@ i know this is probably a joke but for anyone who is for any reason thinking of saying something like this to a cop please dont. its not right, but it could put your life at risk. i genuinely hope that this is an utterly useless comment and this never actually crossed anyones mind, but i had to comment for my peace of mind atleast@ charizard isnt a dragon type tho. classified as a flying lizard@ you can also make a james bond joke here if youd like lol@ 50k more to be safe@ bro what gaming chair does he have?@ i mean could be a different god@ just had some questions my guy@ i really wanna make a james bond joke rn@ bro i think youre facing a hacker@ there was a point in my life where i was ridiculously ripped. i had lost a lot of weight and people always talked about that. i was actually incredibly unhappy with my body (still saw myself as a fatass) and while i dont know if it wouldve made a difference, it would have been nice if it was ever really driven home to me. anyways i gained some pounds after an injury took me out of my sport of 13 years and im happier than ive ever been with my body. plan to get ripped again at some point@ i was originally asking for the vietnam but im actually very interested to hear about any@ how do yall know he cheated? did i miss something?  edit: nvm im an idiot@ i met this girl at a dinner, we conversating. she beautiful in the face by her voice is truly amazing@ dont ever put water on a grease fire@ kinda weird actually. i was lowkey homophobic (in the literal definition, i clenched my butthole around my gay friends but i was never intolerant). i made a friend one day that kinda changed my world view. spent some years being in a weird limbo and im happily pan now@ honestly i think politicalhumor is actually pretty awesome sometimes. i think its peak humor was definitely back in the debates, with all the memes of bloomberg getting absolutely bodied but even now they have some good posts. just sucks that people karmawhore on there so often now@ i am aware of what a coping mechanism is, but was confused to how this could be funny as a coping mechanism. however like you pointed out at the very end here, ive realized that i wont be able to relate as i am not that person. genuinely, thank you for educating me@ *according to the downvotes@ mate, i think i might be miscommunicating  something so let me please try and clarify. this post is simply claiming if you support youre either rich or racist. while i dont necessarily disagree, (i do think there are other reasons people support him, like being very mislead on certain things but being rich and/or racist is definitely some of the reasons) i dont see how this is necessarily humor. the only reason i point this out is because the sub is called politicalhumor, with an emphasis on the humor. for instance, a proper post on this sub could be about trumps idiotic idea of even interacting with woodward. this is because the post would be both political and humorous in nature. you claimed that you found it funny, and when i asked you what about this post was funny (in an effort to see if maybe i had missed some joke) you explained that its a coping mechanism for you. ill be honest im completely lost at this point, and not even sure why im being downvoted either (dont really care about it, just think its interesting). my question to you is how is this a coping mechanism? i am not try in h to start an argument or anything, i genuinely am just curious to hear your answer. if you prefer not to answer please let me know and i wont pursue  edit: typos@ totally agree, just clarifying in case this is a question that could come up@ you find it funny that rich and racist people support trump? it may be true, im not disputing that but how would that be anything else than a known fact?@ yea lol im aware. i just really really really really really really want bnj catwoman, nightwing or inj 2 superman and i get really disappointed every time i dont get them@ i dont completely disagree with this, but respectfully how is this political humor?  edit: just curious to those who are downvoting, why? if ive said something wrong please let me know so i can correct it and learn@ cw is usually catwoman unless used in conjunction with flash. it then refers to meta human flash as the character hes based on is from the cw show@ when im alone id rather be with you@ lmao no way i used the same pack and got her today to e1 too! lowkey im kinda disappointed but still not bad@ lmfaoooo i completely forgot about that. nice snooping my guy@ lmfao alright i gotta bite which post of mine did i talk about that?!@ im not arguing you shouldnt check for context or something. im arguing that i dont think people should check others histories in an effort to find irrelevant information to attack them on. i totally agree with what you just said, that isnt my problem@ im in the same part in regards to the first part. i knew straight off the bat posting this would give quite a few people incentive to look through my profile (as seen in certain comments that actually happened) and as i have nothing to hide i have no problem with it. and while i agree with the second part too, i want to point out that the problem i am expressing in this post isnt simply checking the history, rather referencing completely irrelevant parts to discredit the other person@ exactly thank you! might need to reword this as some have grossly misunderstood@ the community seems to like it lmao but to each their own@ why? i dont think this is karen behavior, but if you feel otherwise please let me know. i just think attacking someone over something irrelevant is an obvious last ditch effort when losing an argument and im kinda tired of seeing it happen@ why is it stupid?@ because shunning turns into doxxing mate. i dont agree with this sort of stuff but its not our place to punish@  coolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcool@ this is just boomer humor at this point@ what posts are you referring to lol@ whats your defense team?@ based@ ha it was injustice 1 i win@ oof post one question after learning that 20% of midgets cant reach their genitals and it never leaves you@ hence why i said at the end shame them if its relevant meaning if their post history is actually relevant to the argument at hand it is appropriate to bring up@ shouldve stopped at 3005 lol@ i feel you so hard man. my cars been at a dealership for a month and a half now because they keep making mistakes and they gave me a loaner base model crv. not that its necessarily bad but moving from my si to this sucks@ based@ dm them or i wont believe@ lmao hell just take it out of our taxes or something@ ah i gotchu my guy. sick car btw @ completely unrelated but which turbo did you end up getting?@ mate you posted this 4 times you good?@ litcherally*@ holy shit 3k posts?!@ totally agree lol. i did drop the ball especially on this one but the circle i definitely have to work on. i promise if you check some of my other vids i do get 200 consistently on the arrows@ also i tried posting a version where i cut out the very end it and it didnt work rip looks like im only posting uncut raw footage lol@ part 2 of my series of weird teams!  glad to see so many people enjoyed my first one!  llamas obligatory disclaimer: by no means am i the greatest player on this sub, nor the most knowledgeable. if you see someone with genuine criticism of something ive said, please pay heed to it. i want to do my best to showcase some of the cool stuff i get excited about in this game and please let me know what i can improve on to give you guys the quality content you deserve!  side note for this video only: political tweet notifications popped up while i was playing. i in no way am trying to say anything political with this i just forgot to take off twitter notifications for this video and im sorry if it was distracting.   quick note about my upload schedule: it fucking sucks, theres no mincing words for it. college and other real life things make life kinda weird for me at this time but hopefully that will change soon.   without further ado:  welcome to llamas weird teams: where ill be showcasing teams i use or that other people suggest and make them work for mp! all these teams will utilize generic and basic gears for the most part, i want these to be teams anyone can use. today im going to showcase my secondary mp team!  green lantern jessica cruz: gauntlets of azrael (yes im aware these teams arent supposed to use cool gears but its only on because i just got it and wanted to try it out. as you will find out, it has 0 effect on todays commentary)  regime green lantern: some random basic damage gear  killer frost prime: no gear im too lazy to put one on   so now most of you are probably thinking llama this isnt a weird team come up with something creative you lazy sack of shit  and honestly youre not wrong for thinking that lmao. this is a very uncreative yet fun team. heres the catch for today: im not actually going to highlight the team members the way most features do. im gonna use this team as an example an alternative way for new players to succeed in the game.   just as in every 60 seconds a minute passes in africa, every 60 seconds a noob asks how git gud fasd on this sub. if you look at any of the comments, its usually about gear, what packs/store golds to buy or get doomsday prime for bb6 with a literal army replying what does bb6 stand for.  ill maintain that thats all good advice, but for all you new players out there i would like you to be aware there are many ways to create a good team. what this team highlights is taking advantage of a niche. in a serious match where im facing a genuinely stacked team the moment jc dies im basically done. rgl (25% power generation increase to my team only) and kfp(50% power generation decrease to the other team only) are both only on here for their passives. by focusing so much on creating a power growth disparity, the possibility that jc gets hit with an sp2 out of the blue significantly decreases. therefore i dont have to worry about running such an unbalanced team. moreover, since this is an mp-only team, the opponents gain very little power for being hit while i gain a decent amount. as jc has one of the best combo enders in the game, landing it twice gives me a guaranteed sp2, which at this stat range is a guaranteed kill for me. simply put, focusing on one specific thing for my team makes it hit hard.   while not as devastating as my rba (but to be fair, most teams arent) this team is really fun for me to play with. to date its never failed to put a smile on face and that is what is truly important when building a team.   hope you guys enjoyed my review, i think ill do my survivor team next and then start on the suggestions yall gave me. also put the damage numbers on because it was so heavily requested@ yea oof even rba cant pull you out of that one my guy@ candy box 2@ oof i figured. i mean point still stands but this is pretty damn misleading. wonder who downvoted me lol@ whats the house price adjusted for inflation?@ bullshit. theres no way trump finishes all the chicken off the wings@ congrats to your mom man@ insurgency sucks but prime is good. consider switching insurgency for something@ my friend thats probably the harshest thing you could say to a guy. just tell him youve never seen a penis before@ nah, its overrated tbh. atleast in my case the girls werent interested in eachother and it made a really weird dynamic. not at all what i thought. maybe itll be different for you?@ maybe so, but not in a conventional sense. just asking people to post the stuff they would want to see on that sub rather than complain about it@ first, please notice im not a filthy unflaired. this post is technically a political compass meme and im not breaking any rules but let me give some more info here:  i posted this to r/politicalhumor an hour ago. it got taken down due to some weird rule about meta posts but before it did i got an interesting comment. its common knowledge on this sub that r/politicalhumor has kinda been trash for a while, but it wasnt always like this. besides a couple comments calling me a karmawhore and one fucking idiot who insisted i was a trump supporter, i got one comment telling me to be the change i wanted to see. im not stupid, i know i probably wont have any effect on the sub alone. but this sub is full of people passionate about politics and their beliefs. this is just a simple call to action: instead of complaining about the shitty sub, simply upload shit thats political and actually funny to r/politicalhumor. lets be the change we want to see@ nah i dont care about making memes about him, i think thats totally alright. whats stupid to me are people who post memes like trump voters are morons, change my mind@ i like that quite a bit actually. thank you, even if it doesnt work atleast ill know i tried@ like a be the change i want to see sort of thing?@ how else do i get my voice heard here?@ nor support him*@ i got my first cart in 5 months (ive been at home with parents stuck in quarantine so ive had little avenue to buy) 3 weeks ago. 2 nights ago i realized ive smoked 17/21 nights i had had the cart. so im taking a break for atleast a week@ what@ just a medium xp augment, not inpressed@ im loudoun (farmwell middle) and we had that too lol@ only need an ares, aquaman, martian manhunter, zatanna and zod to finish my collection@ i think youve misinterpreted the numbers from the report my guy. 9500 people who died from covid had no pre existing conditions and were in perfect health. 180k have still died due to covid as the factor, its just that they also had a preexistint condition too (which could be defined as anything, from having asthma to a bad knee)@ repost@ im sorry this is fucking stupid. i dont like trump but posting orange man bad shit like this is why this sub is a joke to others. this should be our new rule: if its a meme some boomer would repost/forward its not good enough for this sub.@ according to past u/llamathrustulti its a big oof. according to current u/llamathrustulti its stonks@ i know this is worded weirdly but its the only way i could@ lmao lesson has been learned. dont ever sell golds even if its the third best of its kind@ how much?@ challenge. i bought another one right after and got a kanhdaq that i sold (ill never use him so id rather just take the loss. already have two copies from his challenge anyways)@ blasphemy. this is the only card that even rivals regime black adam@ why isnt voting a national holiday? dont we want to foster more voter participation?@ lmao same! if you want, somewhere in my post history i have a few more showcases of this team, some better some worse, all equally sweaty@ yep  i totally admit i messed up lmao. i was really tired and just wanted to get a first video out and see how people liked it. i promise future videos will have more effort put in battkes@ which subs specifically@ what are you asking for it?@ alright so first a disclaimer: im a little tired rn (college fucking sucks when you have to do it online) and this was a shitty example of a battle. from deadshots stupid fucking blocking that i just couldnt break regardless of my gear to the absolute fuckery that were my attempts at using specials on fp batman. simply put, i know i fucked this battle and i swear im much better at playing. i just really wanted to get a video out here to talk about this team that i love and i promise to play better for future teams!   without further ado:  welcome to llamas weird teams: where ill be showcasing teams i use or that other people suggest and make them work for mp! all these teams will utilize generic and basic gears for the most part, i want these to be teams anyone can use. first, i want to showcase my current mp team!  batman prime: level 50 and e2. basic damage and crit gears  lord joker: basic damage gears  regime black adam: basic health gears  with my first character in this match, youll notice two things: 1. i didnt even use batman and 2. i immediately switched him out. for the second point, youre probably wondering why i dont just start out with lord joker. maybe its a superstition on my part but i firmly believe that every time i switch at the beginning of the match i always get the first hit in. so far its had a 100% success rate for me, but may work differently for others. and to the first point, if i play well enough i dont even end up using batman. think of him as the contingency plan: if i really fuck up and my other two are dead, his sp2 usually kills whatever killed them. his 25% added to the others damage also helps quite a lot.   onto lord joker, my main damage dealer. simply spam his light attack each time until i get enough for his sp2 and use it on whoevers the biggest threat. if im facing a bnj nightwing team, ill keep switching him for batman, just keeping him in long enough to rack up power for an sp2 (usually to get rid of the pesky bnj catwoman which comes with those teams). on my best matches, his fantastic stats and his amazing passive run me through an entire team. but when i have multiple threats there is only one card i can call on to fuck shit up~  ~for too long regime black adam has been the scorn of many due to his meh stats. to be fair, he doesnt hit the hardest. but in my option, his passive is one of the absolute best in the game. his orbs either disrupt basic attacks (stalls bnj catwoman long enough for her rage to wear off, or get a few final hits on fp batman before he crit combos me into oblivion) or deals double an sp back. read that again. double. as seen with batman who laughs, one sp1 hit pretty much took care of him. every metal barring catwoman and nightwing gets swept by him. inj 2 superman were himself after trying to punch him. no top tier card has been safe from him. he absolutely decimated teams. look how much health he had after the shot that pretty much killed batman who laughs, its not even close. if you want a card thats easy to learn, but still relevant in the meta this is your guy!   new to all this so please give me feedback, ask any questions and let me know if theres any info i should include!@ if i had coins for an award i would more than happily give it to you@ lmao yep thank you u/skop0s ! in my biased opinion regime black adam is a top tier card. in an unbiased actual review, his stats may not be the greatest but his passive is fantastic. even without health gears, using him right always lets me take out atleast 2 opponents. boss fights are fucking silly with him. even in competitive play hes viable. my current team is batman prime, lord joker and adam. i actually use adam to reliably take out every metal card but catwoman. inj 2 superman (considered to be the best gold card in the game) practically kills himself trying to land his sp1 on adam. basically, black adam is a card that is very easy to learn and use and if used right will absolutely fuck shit up@ my current math professor is a young guy with a young kid. kid is always screaming at whatever tv show hes watching in the background. last week the prof got fed up so he excused himself for a minute but forgot to mute himself. cue the most hardcore immigrant parent screaming ive ever heard in my life, and im asian@ 10$ the guy still claims to be a libertarian@ totally am. hopefully i wont need to@ will do and thank you for the advice@ i thought that, but the warranty company was paying the hours and parts only for the beginning. from what my dad told me, the dealership is the one whos been covering everything else, including the loaner the whole tome@ dont get me wrong, i totally understand mistakes happen. i just have a problem when they tell me its an easy 1 day fix, and that turns into a month long fix due to many mistakes. 1-3 mistakes i can understand. this is more@ i should add: i got my car from carvana and have silver rock warranty@ remember my guy, consistency is whatll keep you there. my very first online was cw flash, i got to top 1% the first day and played lazily for the rest of the week. i barely got top 20%. when reverse flash came out right after, i simply played 10-20 matches a day and was on the top end of the top 5%@ bro same. ive literally taken to playing in between math questions at this point@ still in the game@ i would honestly love to fuck a mermaid or some shit if thats possible@ first to fight hes loyal@ nice@ thank you! ill do my best to make it a kick ass team!@ hmmmm, ill try both and post them when i get a chance!@ shane dawson commented on my post?!?!@ just basic shit and some good survivor stuff. ill list what i use but dont expect stuff like tantu lol@ my mp team btw is batman prime, lord joker and regime black adam. it works fantastically and ill showcase it soon!@ this is something i can help with. songs like jolene, life is a highway and country roads simply bang, but for some people they dont. personally i love those songs but i cant stand pop country, country thats basically gospel music with better guitar and the weirdly misogynistic and racist crap i hear occasionally@ just came here to say everyone is sleeping on john quincy adams. not only was he apparently ripped as shit from swimming in the potomac all the time, but dude was also progressive as hell (against slavery, for womens suffrage and ton of other shit)@ my favorite is regime black adam. he just fucks shit up and is never given enough love@ my middle school had a substitute named harry weiner. it went as well as one would think@ yessir trust me i will   and thanks for the award my guy!@ dude basically makes videos that while are a little bit edgy are either financial advice vids, giving valid criticism of popular creators or criticizing his platform (youtube). last friday youtube up and banned him and gave him no reasons to why. youtube also operates on a 3 strikes rule, of which he had 0@ holy fucking shit what the actual fuck@ ok that might be the worst so far@ the diarrhea one? unfortunately ive already seen it@ honestly its just fucking weird tbh. not as fucked up as some other things on this list but ill be thinking about this at 4 am@ bro your team made me sad@ i live very close to fairfax and used to life there. which walkways are these?@ me and your mama, flight of the navigator, the night me and your mama met (all by childish gambino@ ideal media. the guy just pisses me off for some reason@ depends, what do i get in return?@ no. i just own a question store and you are my employee alex@ same, my friend@ nah pretty sure not. may have one attached tho@ awwwww thats awesome! im excited for yall!@ will do thanks my guy!@ honestly not the greatest. really stressed, im doing online college instead of being on campus for safety reasons and i feel like its all the shitty parts of college without the fun parts. really feel like im missing out every day. thanks for asking tho, you made my day much better! what about you?@ holy fucking shit i thought you were just being an asshole or something to this guy but im sorry and what the actual fuck@ i try to do that a bit, but i wont lie i sometimes click on peoples profiles and maybe feel like im not using the website right. maybe im just being insecure about stupid shit. honestly, i think youre right. im kinda fixating on dumb shit. thanks my guy!@ nah you good. it did, as soon as i put it in my mount it felt like it was struggling to crawl into the back of my throat. terrifying, and i basically bit into it as a panic@ sunyshore city should work for flareon or espeon@ just put this rn. i graduated during covid so my yearbook thing was just a slideshow. im just pissed because like everyone else i put some generic thanks for everything guys stay safe message when i coulda put so long and thanks for all the fish@ youre a celeb?@ recharging my social battery@ rob and rape* i believe@ basically i was fortunate enough to go on a school trip to china my freshman year of high school. i live in a slightly southern state in america so about 60% of the kids going had never gone out of the country. to ease those kids in, for the first week of our two week trip, we were only given american foods, like pizza, french fries, sandwiches, orange chicken and fried rice (i know the last two arent really american, but considering the foods we couldve been trying it was disappointing). basically on the tail end of that i got really disappointed and was desperate to try something new. we had an opportunity to explore a local market where i haggled my ass off (different story but i made a fuckload off of fidget spinners when i got back home). at one point i separated from my group, and saw a stall selling live scorpions that i saw the locals eating. literally thought to myself, fuck it, why not? bought it and ate it. taste wise it was actually not bad. was crunchy and tasted like a sweet beef. but i will never put anything live in my mouth again@ i can tell you a story about how i once ate a live scorpion@ i thought this was some r/politicalcompassmemes shit for a minute@ i gotchu my guy!@ thank you!!@ yep im shameless thanks my guy!@ thanks bro!@ thanks my guy!@ happy cake day!@ ive had the pleasure of having a lot of good teachers, and a lot of shit ones. here all all the shit ones to the best of my memory:  *disclaimer* these are obviously not their real names  1: mrs. racist bitch: my first first grade teacher. i dont remember much from that time period, tbh im probably repressing some of it. as of right now, and most of my life if you have met or meet me in real life i am an incredibly talkative and social person. simply put, this teacher used to bully and demean so much i was practically mute the entire year. it took a lot of help to recover from it. i actually never didnt realize any of this until my parents told me a couple years ago. basically once my parents found out they went ape shit. she somehow didnt lose her job but i was moved to another class  2. mrs. suck ass. i took concert band (played euphonium pretty terribly but hey i tried) and she taught for the 3 years i did in middle school (i also did one year in high school but never marched as i played football). she always made you feel bad for asking questions and is the reason that the high school band is struggling to get kids which sucks because the high school teacher rocks  3. mr pedo: had him in 7th grade and he got caught the year after i had him wanking to cp by a girl in school  4. mr boomer: 9th grade he was a senile old fuck who deleted all my grades back accident. if i wasnt so organized and shit i wouldve failed that class (my counselor was shit)  5. mr bunting: 10th grade english he was the theater teacher who tried wayyyyyyyy too hard to be mr bunting from dead poets society but just came across as a oblivious asshole  6. mr fuckass: calc teacher that was the above guy on steroids. super creepy to girls too and honestly just awful in everyway  bonus: 8th grade geometry teacher who sucked, had over half his class fail the standardized test, got divorced, fired and lost custody of his kid in the same week@ i mean cant you technically use the rolling method?@ u/e_c0lle@ i was going to but i figured leaving the end part would really highlight the struggle@ moose@ hahahahahahahahahahaha that is very [redacted] news, ~~comrade~~ my friend. i thank you for this information and will talk to my close personal good friend vlad about your offer@ or moms slipper man@ there was no movie in ba sing se!@ dude an avatar the last airbender movie would be so freaking awesome@ i always play the album at exactly 12 am. just have to glance at my bedside clock (put it on military for this purpose) to see what song is playing@ thank you so much!!@ and honestly his eps, mixtapes and soundcloud exclusive songs are really good too. centipede is actually my favorite song of his@ how is this political tho?@ yea isnt it just considered an outie?@ https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/   my submission. also anything by comicsnix@ i always pledge that i wont dump all my hams on one mon and try to make the best spread out team i can until i get 5 mons and an azumarill hm slave. every. fucking. time.@ not going to give too much detail because im not comfortable with it but: went to a senior friends party when i was a freshman in high school. there was this one junior girl who really liked me, but i only kinda liked her. she kept giving me drinks that night, pretty much forcing me to drink at one point. i dont remember much but we were basically in the bathroom at one point and i wasnt really functional. i remember she laid me on the floor, took my pants off and had me there. i remember repeatedly trying to say no. at no point did i ever change and consent. i never even talked about it for the longest time, i never thought a guy could get raped. i thought it couldnt have been rape if i enjoyed it and if i had gotten hard it meant i liked it. i remember breaking down and finally telling a friend who validated what i felt. its absolutely fucked.@ or for 8k you can probably find an 8th gen civic si (2005-2011). reliability and performance will be on point, but ill be honest i wouldnt be too optimistic about the interior@ i bought my orange pearl 2015 honda civic si sedan for 15,700, im sure you can find other example for lower. in terms of reliability, ive never had any problems with it. with gas mileage im looking at high 30s on average, could probably beat that if i tried. performance wise it feels fantastic. its a car you can actually handle at its limit, but by no means is slow@ probably find a good 8th gen civic si (2005-2011) for that price@ you could probably find a 8th gen civic si (2006-2011) in decent condition for that price@ didnt attend but my cousins wifes sister had her wedding and all went well until her other sisters husband died in a car crash on the way to the reception@ completely agree. i keep seeing this one post implying that youre a fascist if you criticize her while we have a literal fascist in office (not taking a stance on that btw, only quoting as it is a direct quote from post). ive managed to comment/dm that its super fucking ironic theyre implying youre a fascist while theyre the ones saying you cant criticize people@ totally shes facing a ton of stupid fucking racism, but i swear people are getting their rocks off on getting on some false moral high ground and its pissing me off. sorry about the bernie thing, tbh while i tend to disagree with his policies when ive critiqued them ive never gotten any flack from supporters but to each their own@ i follow a lot of accounts from different sides, from my experience the left accounts and right accounts are both divided on their feelings to her@ ill totally agree. ive seen enough shit on r/insanepeoplefacebook to reaffirm my belief that people are the fucking worst. but shit like this is why people get disillusioned with politics and dont vote@ ah all good my guy, thanks for bringing it to my attention tho!@ totally understand. nothing i said ever mentioned race, want to clarify that first. i shared posts criticizing her hypocritical behavior regarding marijuana (being extremely harsh on it as a prosecutor and a lawmaker to the point her republican opponent for the senate office actually ran to the left of that issue while she tried to lie about smoking it in college to try and be relatable), her opposing reforming californias 3 strikes rule, appealed a case resulted in continual capital punishment being allowed in her jurisdiction, her refusal to prosecute against the catholic church sex abuse scandal and a ton of other positions or actions she has taken in the past that i definitely dont agree with@ from what im aware of, thats not a rule. however if it is please let me know and ill be more than happy to delete this@ basically any criticisms ive vocalized against harris since the announcement has been met by a few randoms on my socials going off on me for being racist and a trump lover. i dont like trump, never criticized harris on anything relating to her race or gender and im indian@ gotta put it here due to multiple interactions on social media: im the kid of 2 indian parents who immigrated here, i consider myself an independent and i generally do not like trump@ would love to hear how having genuine criticisms of someone not based on their race, gender or anything they cant control makes any of us racists. and before you even ask ill let you know i definitely do not intend on voting for trump, and am the biological child of two indian immigrants@ i feel you my guy. if only denice halicki wasnt such a bitch@ someones sex and race does not define their value in public office. yes, its fucking cool we have a woman of color who might happen to win vp, dont get me wrong. as the kid of two indian immigrants it definitely excites me and makes it seem more realistic that it could one day be me. but dont get it twisted for a second: i am not happy with this ticket (even if i plan on voting for it) and will continue to openly criticize her and anyone else i think is shit. the best irony here is you calling trump a fascist while youre the one saying we cant criticize your nominee. final note: giving valid criticism does not make trump more fascist, nor makes our position worse@ aye i feel you my guy. had a 2004 my parents bought new that i drove to 306k miles last year. transmission blew and repair was more expensive than what the car was worth so we ended up trading it in but damn i loved it@ cuz only god survived@ oooo what car was it?@ fuck off john quincy adams is fucking perfect @me@ i asked something about why girls did certain things when flirting with guys. was immediately removed, reason given simply said something like not all girls and further conversation was the mod being extremely rude to me. i feel you my guy@ whats insane about this?  /s@ i actually just want to use this to apologize. in the past ive phrased questions on this sub directed to women by referring to them as females. i realized today that it sounds quite demeaning and from the bottom of my heart, i apologize for insulting anyone. i had no intentions of doing such, and i will do better in the future@ 1. regime black adam. stats may be underwhelming but his passive is so incredibly underrated. any character that can melt through all the metals (barring catwoman) that easily should be fucking worshipped  2. lord joker has a great light combo and incredible passive. hes actually my hitter for mp, his sp2 always wins me matches. new 52 shazzy and jess cruz can go here for the same reasons, just dont use them in mp  3. ak hq and antimatter sinestro have a fantastic synergy which is so fun when it works  4. dead shot suicide squad hits nice  5. batman prime and new 52 nightwing for sentimental value   probably forgot some@ 18, student (but i tutor atm and have had several part time jobs and other gigs), 15 honda civic si sedan@ i cant unlock all my doors by pressing the button on the drivers door. i either need to touch the front passenger handle, unlock all with the button inside or hit the button on my keys@ i believe in you too, make us proud!@ aw sweet! my mom was an exchange student in vancouver for 2 years before college in the states! also went to toronto once before (childhood friend lives there) and loved it!@ yea. luckily not a lot of its violent (it was a much bigger problem when i was younger) but racism continues to be a problem@ wont lie, in my experience if youre indian and ask for spicy they give it to you. if youre not and ask they give you much less so ill be honest the best advice i could give is to ask them to make it as spicy as they would personally enjoy it@ aye nice to meet you my guy! parents from india, what about yours?@ sorry im slow what am i missing?@ and same here with my batman prime and regime black adam@ what gen pilot? had a 2004 i got from my parents up til last year (transmission blew at 300k miles) and i loved it@ my first gold from a pack was regime black adam. second was bat prime. third was adam again, fourth was bat. i got adam once again as a drop from a level and on my fifth i got bat again. cant complain and i actually use both on mp to great success@ shit im orange pearl i need a charm andre!@ /s promote batman who laughs   in all seriousness jessica cruz is the way to go for promos and is a must have on your team@ regime black adam, with jess cruz and lord joker in a tie for second@ yea ok he sucks but not sure if i want to give him up especially since ill unlock him for direct promotions@ and i dont even use her lmao. only harley i like is al hq because it has a perfect synergy with antimatter sinestro@ i dont and like a dumbass skipped to the end and lost all my cash. dont have a zod for next week so guess who has two thumbs and has to hardcore grind!@ because the past three times i wanted to kill myself i wimped out completely@ im partial to 9th gens but there may be a bit of bias in that lmao@ nah he fucking rocks dont sell him@ 14,700 for a 15 sedan with 72k miles@ i have enough to do so im pretty sure, but ill be honest i dont think ill ever use her@ as ideal as this is, this sub only has 8k members so im not sure how many will sub because of the post to begin with. if he hits 500 i promise i will be the first to shoutout again tho@ i do, my mom needs hydrox for her lupus. shit like this makes it harder@ i melted through flash btw, despite what i thought darkseid would do@ congratulations my guy! super stoked and subbed!@ this situation being covid ofc@ the series most people think about when you say clone wars or the one by the guy who made samurai jack?@ black adam needs to move up big time@ just depends on the gears imo. bnj fucks me up if i dont think about my strategy upfront and flashpoint ruins me if they use fp bats at the start with crit gears@ as a car enthusiast, i can unfortunately say ive met a lot of these sorts of people at some of the local car meets@ your first time having sex@ mlms.@ mlms.@ thanks everyone! turns out my friend accidentally sent me the wrong date but i was complimented on what i wore so much appreciated! u/slash178 u/tryntastic u/crystalstarship and u/whenwillyoumarryme@ im a guy btw, its for high school@ u/skopos gonna get 11/10@ damn man, yall got some low miles. my parents bought the same one new and the tranny blew last year at 306k miles@ same@ for instance: while often not talked about, it is a known fact that all poo poo times are pee pee times but not all pee pee times are poo poo times.@ team idea if youd be up for it (just randomly thought about it no idea if itd even work tbh): regime nightwing with the no basic damage set up, earth 2 grundy and prime frost@ civic sis sub 2012@ seconded@ its awd really helps the launch@ edge st?@ 1st gen honda pilot would do you well@ awesome list!@ based@ i got one too (15 si sedan)@ this just made me realize ive never played without my phone off mute@ we spend it, with no shame@ we spend it, with no shame@ it worked! you are a fucking god my guy! now the only thing i lost is a years worth of pictures and texts!@ awesome thank you!@ driving different cars@ street racing@ there was one that felt too much like rape. reported it too if i remember correctly@ nah mate i dont think hes saying segregation is aight. basically muslim women (depending on their level of faith) are not allowed to show their hair to anyone other than immediate family or those of the same faith and gender. because of this, they arent able to go to spas or other places where those who do not fit in the criteria. the business caters to this, only allowing muslim women in therefore letting them have their hair out. its not segregation, simply a business who is guaranteeing a certain level of privacy@ wait pornhub how did i not think of that fuck wikipedia@ wikipedia. learn the fuck out of everything@ nice car!!! nice to see im not the only orange 9th sedan here lol@ no suggestions but if you want to do voiceovers for them im more than happy to edit (dm me if you want me to)@ you have a very unhealthy view of your body my guy. you need to stop pushing yourself as such, because you end up injuring yourself and taking yourself out of your sport of 10 years. i know you feel fat and that you need more muscle and all the other crap but the truth is that a) youre ripped and b) youll be happier when you have a bit of stomach but keep the muscle. also do more work in school you lazy shit@ 1st gen acura nsx@ because logan paul has matured and makes actually good content now. never really watched youtube tbh till late 2018 around when the fight happened. watched the fight because my little bro was interested, recognized logan from the japan video and wrote him off at the time. after the fight i started to watch a bit more youtube and started watching some of his vids. ive watched maybe a couple of his old vids and they arent anything like his new ones are. if its a matter of personal preference than to each their own but i find his current vlogs to be entertaining (cant stand his old ones tho). his podcast is fantastic and tbh the only podcast i listen too. if youre judging him based on the japan video, all i can say is that if people deserve a second chance then in my opinion logan has definitely earned that right with a lot of his more recent actions. jakes videos are just as fucking annoying as his older ones were and hes still a massive piece of shit tho@ in my opinion hes fantastic, especially to newer players. his stats arent as good but his passive is fucking brilliant if you learn how to use it right@ totally get that he no wear mask and he bad but i really wanna fucking see the burnout video@ this is awesome! i run am sinestro with ak hq on survivor, lowkey feel its quite an underrated synergy@ lmao i only bought once and i actually got her@ i had a ton of cash and spent it as a joke and actually got her so    edit: should include i only bought it once@ mine corrected itself @ r/sino incase anyone is too lazy to search@ yea im gonna put minimal effort this season lol@ im currently running batman prime as a physical tank and dealer. running basic attack gears on him. should i try and get the batmobile and run it on him? dont really use super moves unless im fucking around tbh@ im currently running batman prime as a physical tank and dealer. running basic attack gears on him. should i try and get the batmobile and run it on him? dont really use super moves unless im fucking around tbh@ ive only bought two packs so far. my first one was a 200 and i got regime hawk girl (which i was happy about because i didnt have a hawk girl at the time but the bn hawkgirl challenge ran right after so ) and my second was a 400 and i got metal shazam. guess which pack im going to buy again@ mass appeal, orange rind smoke your green im spending mine@ lmao this is like me and arons23(mate if youre out there im truly sorry) only i keep beating the shit out of him and hes never beat me@ if it contributes something to my life, whether entertaining or informative@ could you do regime black adam?@ black adam regime. i know his stats arent as good but i run basic health gears on him and he always takes down atleast one other character@ infinite weed?@ and ak hq@ awesome! just hope you dont run into inj 3 aquaman@ vhs tapes. my little brother is only 3.5 years younger and is absolutely bamboozled by them. rotary phones too but i find some people even younger than him know so @ wassup my guy@ dropping jewels like its puberty@ dude im so hyped with fp death stroke and dead shot i can finally make an awesome team with lord joker!@ yea that was my first thought@ the skittles one@ what if its a really big and buff ten year old? he even has a yellow belt!@ gahhhh fuck u fuck u i did it i have more penis on me why@ uhhhhhhhhhh no reason this is totally not based on real life just a completely hypothetical and random situation hahaha@ thats honestly fucking terrible to hear, i hope you guys find better alternatives its their loss not yalls. thank you so much for educating me too!@ o and anything ac/dc@ anything by gambino or cant hold us by macklemore@ i want to apologize for my ignorance here, im a guy and have very minimal experience with bras and buying them. why would vs stop carrying sizes that high (looking at the comments im assuming thats above a d please correct me if im wrong)? do they not make enough money off of it or is there some reason im completely lost at?@ my little brother broke his arm trying to do a backflip on an exercise ball. i broke my nose swimming@ having interests@ catwoman by far. id say nightwing is a close second, then batman who laughs or black adam, shazam and the metal ares@ f@ jsus holy fucking shit man!@ yea anything in that second paragraph belongs here lol. this first one is a kinda lame car joke, but definitely not insane. hell my dads had two bmws and i never stop giving him shit for them the same way he never stops making jokes about my civic@ 04 honda pilot. parents bought it new and gave it to me when i needed a car. tranny blew eventually and the repair was more than the car itself was worth so we ended up selling it. we put 300k miles on it and i cried for weeks. perfectly happy with my current car tho@ if i could afford gold id give it my guy@ dumb question for anyone whos more military than me (practically any of yall): wouldnt this be a violation of use of the flag?@ will do ty!!@ will keep in mind ty my guy!@ aye thanks! already started practicing appreciate it all!@ hopefully i can get that sense thanks man!@ thank you so much for the input! i totally need to keep working on the blocking, and will remember the timing tips you gave! as for the but at the end, its one of the many reasons i use him, hes so much fun! lastly, what is frame tapping?@ youre totally right with adam, but i find him quite a lot of fun to play with. however as i recently drew metal shazzy from a 400 i can try a new team! will keep in mind about joker! thank you so much for the advice!@ to elaborate on a couple things because i can guess this will come up: i suck at timing blocks (especially with black adam), and while my team choice is admittedly weird, it kinda works@ skopos you are a god, and we love you. would love to see any of this!@ yea shes the one exception. every time i face her i either completely destroy her, or i kill her teammates easily and she cuts through my team like hot butter@ kissmovies.com my guy@ bro i know right?!@ sadly you have yet to be disproven@ wait sorry i get what you mean. not calling adam op, saying that hes good too take out unbalanced teams and let my other two clean up@ never said hes super op. but ive been able to tank multiple hard specials due to the gears and basically give myself at best a couple of free knockouts because of it@ will keep in mind, thank you my guy!@ unova was the worst loss fight me@ wd-40 is the only real essential oil@ i got a gold once@ whats your dream car my guy? and what you driving rn?@ cars@ agree with you on the priests part but i think there are totally valid reasons to own that car otherwise@ dont get me wrong, it was totally fucked. but after the shitty apology video he took every step to change himself for the better. he didnt just donate to suicide prevention charities but made actual attempts to educate himself on the issue and teach others. he not only recognized every single detail that got him to that point but did his best to eliminate it all. he knows he can never right his wrong, but tries to right and educate himself and others and tries to grow as a person. at the end of the day, if logan doesnt deserve redemption than none of us do@ im going to get shit for this but logan paul makes surprisingly good content now. never watched him until after the first fight, only knew him from japan. he comes off incredibly intelligent and genuine in his podcasts and his vlogs are bearable to watch (i hate watching vlogs otherwise tbh)@ yep lol. wont lie i suck at mp so after sticking all the health gears i have on him, his passive usually takes care of an opposing member or two@  i use him on my main team, hes pretty awesome@ i can only afford a silver but you definitely deserve it my guy! good on you for making the best out of life!@ holy god damn fucking shit what the actual fuck did i just read@ im the shit, when these dude talk they talkin bout me ah!@ u@ thanks for the elaboration my guy, greatly appreciated! someone probably saw it and assumed i was saying something like acab or some shit. ill edit it to clear it up@ robert downey jr@ cops suck but northern virginia is pretty awesome  edit: virginia cops suck for reasons beautifully elaborated by u/temptags below. im not saying acab or any political statement@ will do mate! and awesome on the mount end!@ aye ill download it later if i can mate, will lyk!@ f@ whats the good my guy?@ get a civic si. i drive one and its practical, easier on insurance and still plenty fast@ lmao i wont lie even i get annoyed seeing some of these extremely one sided questions being asked. wouldnt have a problem honestly if they even tried to phrase it more neutrally@ i 100% respect that@ one of my gts is llamathrust (after an old who wants to be a millionaire meme) and it was taken. my other gt is ultimatron(ace)12 but when i play most people call me ulti. hence, llamathrustulti@ any help is greatly appreciated@ watchmen reference?@ who can give me a better handjob. ive been practicing my entire life so ill probably win, but if i lose a handjob of that quality must be worth it@ ah damn, appreciate it my guy@ how has porn not been mentioned?!@ what does that mean in american?@ the night me and your mama met by childish gambino  something by the beatles@ /s real men dont need to know how to stop. those with a true pair crash@ not entirely avoiding death, but trouble. my parents were leaving for paris on september 10th,  2001 while my mom was pregnant with me. basically the night before i decided i wanted to get out early (ended up staying for a couple more months luckily) and my parents were forced to cancel and go to a hospital. from what i was told, as both my parents had green cards at the time it would have been extremely hard for them to return due to high tensions and the fact that they were islamic had they actually gone to paris@ epstein didnt kill himself/isnt even dead@ what she did is shitty,and she deserves to rot in hell for that. using a slur like that isnt cool tho, even if she deserves it@ what car tho@ ive learned more about crocheting from this thread than anywhere else lol@ same lol, but she cheated on me with her best friend for a month before and then to save face told every that me and a friend were also

  you reckon she would allow me to do it for 1,000,000,000 ?    that's realistically the only way it could happen, legally.@ i like this piece.   it really highlights the hopelessness of the situation and nails the typical characters of belfast city centre work life to a tee.   \"look at the state ovum!\"  that was my first thought - cause just look at them!  look at the state of yer mans nose and that wanker that can hardly stand up straight.    steven looks like a tosser and to be honest, no wonder his wife left him when he hangs about karaoke bars.    probably stinks too cause he's a smoker and look at the gut on him.  unhealthy, ugly and probably can't get it up either.   these pair would probably do better bucking each other because god knows they aint gettin any ladies.    also, the grey skies and shitty non-memorable buildings are also perfect for belfast.  what a shithole!

 hahaha@ nah@ \"berties at it again, mother!\", exclaimed janice.   berties partially erect bulbous tip was slowly but surely filling with blood.  but he was impatient.  bertie was always the impatient one.  ever since bertie was a child he wanted things *now* and not later.  bertie squeezed the semi hard tip into the gaping asshole of lottie.  lottie pulled and strained, bent over, her wrinkled hands pulling her soft and loose butt cheeks tight, exposing a well used anus, a well used anus of perhaps 79 years.  \"ooeer! yes, bertie, just like that!\", lottie sighed with a breath of exhaustion similar to that of someone with chronic lung disease.  bertie squeezed and squeezed, and eventually he managed to inch in the tip of his penis into lotties asshole.  it reminded him of trying to stuff a pillow into a half full washing machine.  sure it wasn't fun, but it was something that had to be done.  \"cough cough, ooh! bertie!\", exclaimed lottie.  \"uhh.. ohhh mmmm, yes?\" - bertie moaned.  this was a lot of action for the elderly couple.  and any minute now, would berties penis be fully erect.  any minute now.  the minutes went by, and it seemed like a lifetime (which both lottie and bertie were grateful for) - but berties penis, finally had enough rigidity, to slide in and out of lotties arse with a tempo similar to the pendulum of the grandfather clock ticking in the background.  \"oooooeeerr!\" gasped lottie.  \"ohhhhh ehhh\", she moaned.  \"huh huh huh huh huh huh..just a minute lottie!\", bertie was on the rampage, he felt like a 60 year old again.  it was a long time bert pumped like this.  maybe even as far back as 'nam, when he raped and pillaged a small village, but that's another story.  \"oooerr..ooooh\", cried lottie.  her butthole was lubed with the natural juices of piss, pre-cum and general ass juice so the motions were working quite well.   \"i think i'm going to come.. oohh huhhhh euughh\".. \"yes, yes lottie, i, too, am going to come! huh huh huh eeeuuuuughhhhhhh\"  bertie squirted out a little puff of semen, not extaordinary by any means, but enough to please lottie.  \"that really was a jolly good time!\", laughed bertie.  janice was sick to the back teeth of listening to those horny old farts in the apartment above.@ you know what.  i'm gonna do that now.  it's gonna be a total shit show.  let's see what i can do.@ i am soooo glad i decided not to become a bartender after watching, \"cocktail\".    dodged a bullet there@ alright, so the feedback i'm getting from you is that you want to see more from yvonne?  more sex.  got it.  (again, this is just a proof of concept, i was going to do a choice of position, doggy-style, anal etc)@ it's the usual disgruntled person sitting at home, thinking, \"everyone needs to behave like i

surveillance to make sure she isn't gaslighting you.  what i recommend is cutting off the bottom of a showergel container - lynx works well, because it's dark and conceals the hole for the camera.  insert your phone into the container and position it at the toilet.  make sure it's zoomed in, because you want to catch the actual droplets, a before and after of the toilet seat.  then, in future, when you are accused of pissing on the seat, you can simply show the footage that tells a different story.  hope this helps - let me know how you get on.  regards,  yellow-gal-pissy-flaps-69@ i did

snapped) drives away, taking random pot shots out the window at groups of people on the street, fatally wounding a 17 year old student by hitting her in the neck. 12 others wounded.  he drives about, there's sirens, then he finally rests the gun barrel in his mouth and pulls the trigger - blam! all his brains are blown out and you can hear the splash of blood and bone debris and tissue all painted over the headrest of the drivers seat.  it eventually makes the breaking news and buzz makes a statement and the world is in shock.  joe pesci tells a nostalgic story of how fun it was working with macauley culkin and what a pleasure it was to diversify to a more comedic role.  the taxi-man turns out to be called, \"robert sampson\", an online sexual predator. a paedophile that was never caught.  19 terrabytes of explicit category 5 (the highest category) of child porn was discovered across ten 2tb ssd drives.  turns out robert was hosting child porn for 8 years under the online alias, \"shitty-plops-man-69\" and had over 3 bitcoin in his crypto-wallet.  roberts co-workers all said, \"he seemed like such a normal everyday guy, i'd never thought he'd be capable of all this? i'm just

nothing to live for.  then i became an alcoholic.  one of the best decisions of my life at the time.   every day, i needed a drink, and when i got my drink, suddenly everything was alright again!  i lived for the drink.  my suicidal thoughts were forgotten about because all i thought about was where the next tin was coming from.  then i hit rock bottom and cleaned myself up.  and see the feeling of beating an addiction like alcoholism? it's amazing.  it really made me feel like i could do anything when i beat the drink.  now i'm forever fixed and life is great because i know, that if it ever gets bad again, i can just go out and buy some frosty jacks again.  life is easy when you have it all figured out!  good luck!@ why not pretend that you are a hobbyist train-spotter? then the trains

 ball park.@ jesus wept the bed and is now banned from dreams and harvey norman@ can you ask her if she dreamt she was pissing, and then woke up with a pissed bed?   i think there's a correlation to dreaming about pissing and actually pissing.  me and someone else up there have known a few cases of this and i'd be really interested if you could get this additional data on this case.    thanks@ great, thanks@ link?@ i've never been down south.  why?@ no, don't have the link, but it's about somewhere, i'm sure you'll find it after scrolling@ is there any peer reviewed research studies to back this up, and if so, please link them, i'd be very interested to read them, however i think you just made this up.@ you're on a thread called, \"how to have a wet dream in northern ireland\" - you're actually here, commenting! omg!! did you actually think this was going to be an academic research paper or something?

(i forgot to consider the millisecond timing between, signal, push and result, it was never going to be at the same time, rookie mistake in calculations - and oh the irony of being in math class.)  all that happened was my friends coughing drew attention to me farting, leaning on one butt cheek, rasping against a plastic school chair.  what i thought was going to happen was that~ (for lack of a better explanation~ but in computing, when two tasks are done at the same time, it's called threading)  ~so my friends cough and my fart would happen at the same time, partially masking it.  except in reality, we had no threading, it was just concurrent operations.  cough cough cough fffffffffrrrrrrrrrrttttttt.  the aftermath.  well, we both burst out laughing and i got sent out of the room to stand in the corridor.  and it was one of my most memorable room dead silent, massive fart scenarios.@ genghis khan@ i am going to watch some halloween themed porn, the one where michael myers actually catches jamie lee curtis and then bums her, - never mind apple pies, try cream pies and then he walks away for the next victim.    the only weapon he's stabbing people with, is his cock.  amazin@ did a shart a couple weeks ago@ hipster wanker.  go drink your stupid flavour tea and super food snack@ speaking as someone who plays loud music in their headfones i do it because i want ppl to hear my music and kno that i am cool@ edwin poots is so backward, his name should be edwin stoop. i mean he surely *is* stooping to all sorts of new lows, even for the dup!@ my kinda woman, bet she takes it up the pipe n all@ nyet@ the taig version of covid is less deadly than the hun version fuckin typical@ what u just said makes no sense at all. i'd urge everyone to just tl;dr its nonsense it'll save ya 20 seconds@ yep, that's the bit@ yeah i agree, op do it yourself, ya lazy wee bastard@ most were, but this set the most famous set got bypassed@ they're trees that you pass on the way to dublin, from ballymoney@ ion and framing@ yeah i was at a bangin house party last night, only about 20 of us maybe 25 max, but it was great craic - and we're all in our 20s so don't go on sayin we're irresponsible when we're hardly gonna die or even get hospitalised@ what if someone asks you a question, but you don't know the question was directed at you?

this is your wank story@ yeah and she's got a nice big hairy and smelly armpit to lick and she's like this, \"oof i fancy a kebab after this, you look after my kids and i'll be right back\"  then she comes back, and she's only bought one kebab, and she says, \"sorry luv, i only had enough for me, but you can have some if i've any left over\"  and then she eats it and doesnt leave ya any and shes stinkin of garlic now and she goes, \"right lets buck again nai luv\"  and then your buckin er and all ya smell is garlic and her smelly arm pits.  and then she throws you out after cause love islands comin on the telly innit,  now ya have to cycle on home.  so you get on your bike and you're ragin ya got no kebab and your tummys rumbling like mad so it is, but thats not all  youre still half baked from hittin a few bowls earlier and your cyclin along and you just smash straight into a lamppost cause you wernt watchin where ya were goin ya racket ye anyway  you get back on your bike and make it home and your phones only on 15%, but that's enough to watch a 10 min vid on porn hub with the screen brightness turnd down so u turn on porn hub and search, \"big titted blonde eatin kebab in balloo, bangor\" - and you find one result  u tap on the result and guess wat, u cant believe it, it's her so it is.  aye, the one u just bucked like 30 minutes ago.  so u tap the screen, and shes just eatin a kebab with big tits.  u get out your willy and start pulling it and tickling your balls goin, hee hee hee until youv a shaky boner and then u start wankin and then u cum again, just like that  it gets on your hand a bit and your like this, aw fucks sake, and u just wipe it on your tshirt, sure whos gonna see like anyway, and u can throw it in the wash the marra.  then u just go to bed@ i was born siamese twin on my head, head to head, but my twin died at birth and i had surgery to remove them.   however.   big however.  they were attached via eye socket at the back of my head, so that couldn't be safely removed due to risk of brain injury, so i have kept one eye and have learnt how to use it as well as the two eyes on the front of my head.  so i keep that one at the back mostly closed all the time and my hair covers it.    i can actually see out the back of my head if i close my front eyes, and open my back eye.  the image is not as good as my frontal vision, the image is blurry somewhat and a little lacking in color, but for the most part i can see fine - shapes of people etc, i can read text if it's very close.    it's my party trick i do to freak people out that don't know me.@ yeah, i guess that would work - still not the city though! no surrender@ \"derry city and strabane local council area\" - she was calling the council area by it's name, not the city of londonderry.   sorry, this isn't a win this time. if you asked her what the city is at the mouth of the foyle and she said, \"derry\" - then that would be a win, but unfortunately this time, she's just referring to the name of the council area.@ might be more helpful to \"ai enhance\" the bicycle?@ ano this cunt cant spell for duck all@ i can just imagine that manager sitting, evaluating the holiday request~ \"hmmmm.. hmmmm~ no, i don't think i will let you and your family go on that holiday, no~ no, i don't think i will.\" - and then they decline the request.  and they stand up, look out the window with a little smarmy smirk on their face and feel great!@ found a dead body in balloo?

 i think it's more like 0.3%.  which is still a huge number.@ let me tell you something you already know.  the world aint all sunshine and rainbows. its a very mean and nasty place, and i dont care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. you, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.but it aint about how hard you hit, its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. how much you can take and keep moving forward.thats how winning is done!  now if you know what youre worth, then go out and get what youre worth! but you gotta be willing to take the hits. and not pointing fingers saying you aint where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! cowards do that and that aint you! youre better than that!@ yeah, that's better@ what kind of nest of lies do you mean?  i was thinking of faking being pregnant, to give me a few weeks to think and then fake a miscarriage, this will buy me time - is this what you mean?@ i have an electronic face massager, use that every evening and moisturize daily, that's all you can do.@ hahaha it's true, that's me bottom left@ exactly! the whole thing is the pits.  hope they catch this screwed up waste of space.@ isn't that obvious!  maybe this rookie would be better off down in dublin then!@ why's that?  you can get better news coverage?@ icu? more like i dont c u@ yeah, it's terrible.  women as it is don't have the luxury of feeling safe at night on the streets the same way guys do.  and this just makes it worse.@ i would urge everyone who has information leading to the arrest of the belfast slasher to come forward immediately and i absolutely, categorically condemn these attacks.@ yeah that sounds much better, but i hope they catch this, \"belfast slasher\" soon - there has to be good quality cctv, surely?@ they're starting to call him, \"the belfast slasher\" - i wish people would stop giving cool nicknames to these maniacs, it only encourages them further!@ \"the siiiiimp-sons\" - i say it all the time, because my neighbors across the street are the simpson family, and every time i see their car pull into the drive, i go, \"the siiiiimp-sons dun dun dun, da-dunnn dun dun, da dun-dun-dun-dun, da dun-dun-dun dunnn, dun-dun-dun\".@ it's only a thousand million@ $50 ?@ have you actually tried it?  the technique is to bend over, naked, and push like you are trying to poop, then relax, then push, then relax, eventually u will suck in air in the relax phase and then push, and a fart happens, i am erect now@ apparently most women can do this, it's just they don't tell everyone.@ she is able to suck the air into her butt whilst bent over, and then she pushes it out again.@ when i say i don't want anything for my birthday, i mean it.  if i want something, i buy it myself.  if you buy me something, i have to fake an emotional response which is not much of a gift is it? i will warn you only once more.  if you buy me anything when i say i don't want anything you will end up paying the ultimate price.  now get out of my sight.@ i used to know a sex worker and she used to say that the most common weird thing she gets, which is actually really really common is guys wanting her to bend over naked and fart in their face.@ if you like this comment pass it on@ halfa jaffa@ interesting insight there, thank you.@ \"this was an absolutely distressing experience the heavily shocked and terrified member of staff who was in their place of work, trying their best to do their job where they should rightly and justly feel safe to do so in northern ireland during these troubled times with a global pandemic winter just around the corner, and i condemn it completely\", stated the north belfast mla who is themselves recovering from a bout of covid-19 illness which gripped the community earlier in the week more on this live at six don't miss out from more local news stories this october 2020  100 words@ i'm a tot je suis a tot@ ghosted bastards@ remember drazik?

i know!@ grow babies in test tubes and use them to harvest organs. make jewelry and other items from excess skin and bones. or burn it as fuel?@ don't know why the downvotes, you seem to be arguing your point well.  in march/april we had probably 50,000 new corona infections a day in northern ireland~ spreading like an invisible fire throughout care homes and to the most vulnerable.    now coming into winter, there's nowhere near the same amount of infection - it looks worse because of increased testing, but the death rates prove that we're at the very very start of this \"second wave\".    northern ireland is testing roughly 8,000 - 10,000 test currently - i'll start to worry when 75% of tests are coming back positive.@ yeah we are really good~ we delayed the first wave until flu season winter 2020~ we're geniuses@ most people in the uk just don't bother thinking that northern ireland is a thing unless you're from here@ it's standard scam procedure to steal a ram stick. normally if questions are asked you can say it was faulty and its in the trash and offer to sell them another.@ i suppose you wrote things like, \"keep calm there's no body here~plenty of time~keep calm~the man thought to himself as he hurriedly cleaned the room for the arrival of his guests \"@ you have to use the \"layers\" option on the right hand side.  and you can select different map data that's labeled by year window. they don't have yearly data, it's only about 5 or 6 different windows of time.@ \"smooth-brained facebook-addled pricks\" lol@ glory glory northern iiiiiiireland@ yeah, this is my second thread comparing and contrasting what used to be.  i guess i just discovered this resource and decided to shout and scream and let everyone else know about it.  i don't think i will spam any more threads about it - i would encourage everyone to go check it out!  you can go to your area, and look back in time and see who was the first houses in your area~ you can even ascertain who the original farmers and land owners were, and who sold land to who, if you know you local geography and neighbourhood families well enough!@ source:  @ cover it in blue-tack and then use the same amount of blue-tack on four corners of a poster in my room@ yeah, i've since learnt that the old linen hall had, \"a noble library of 10,000 volumes\" - which i assume when it got demolished in 1896 to make way for the city hall as we know it, the books were transferred to another building - the linen hall library.  interestingly, during this time, belfast was having a boom - expanding rapidly due to a thriving linen, rope works and ship building industries - belfast even overtook dublin as the most populous city in ireland at this time~.then it all kinda went tits up after that as everyone's aware@ yeah, regrettably, i worded the title wrong~ due to my own ignorance@ maps here:   @ awesome pictures and info!@ old maps here:  \n",

someone treated us bad then i think its easier.@ i hate ehormony  i paid for two years membership my biggest mistake  all matches are not what i am looking for@ dont leave him if you think he is good person just compromise with his parents for few months no one is perfect everyone has issues.  you are not going to find someone perfect if you leave him. once you will leave with his parents they will understand that you guys are not happy then they will respect your decision  its just my views you dont have to do what i said but just think few month of compromise is wroth it for someone nice and someone who loves you.@ i am going through same thing, if he liked us or loved us they never left us. why we care for selfish human being who never respect or care for our feelings.  i want him back badly but then some times i think he is not wroth is . someone who put me in that much pain why i want him back. dont make sense@ so is that means any guy could not see my profile unless i dont

life we have here but still i love to live there. money is only reason for mostly immigrants who are staying here. since, back home is more social life and not long working hours of work. thats reason i see many immigrants who make money and leave us. or the once who have money they just visit dont stay. yes we have one life to live@ please help me , i lost lots of money on gambling on 2019. now i dont have job but whenever i have money i gamble. where did you get help thanks@ thanks, i am looking for serious relationship.@ i am sorry i feel your pain. i had similar situation.@ i think their intention was to know how much you make . they shared so you share as well@ yes , i want to know sooner then later . you are right .@ thank you so much @ i am dating for long term relationship possible marriage@ there lifestyle shows like surgeons or lawyers etc..@ sure i can easily pay for dates@ they are surgeons, lawyers and with some of them i talked over the phone ( the car they have

in the end . please wake up ( dont feel offended pls)@  i am sorry but i left my bf because of his female friend. they were just friends but i was not comfortable with situation. he was tired of me i was argue with him all time . i am from middle east he is american. its not common in our culture.  unfortunately you have to leave him or accept him with his female friend.@ you are so sweet thank you so much! yes, i think we hurt more when we date after long period of time. we are not used to of break up things . my situation was different, i gave him more attention and love. i had crush on him. he knew about it so started to treat me very bad. in the beginning i thought he was kind person since he was 16 years older then me but i was wrong . thanks again for kind words , yes doesnt matter how old we are breakup is painful@ you are very strong or maybe you was not in love with him please dont feel offended  its hard to move on and heal@ happened with me many times @ i dont know why we dont have self respect for ourselves, i meant whats reason to miss someone who treat us bad and leave us. its very painful i thought breakup is painful only when we were in teen age .@ i also broke up with him but he started to pushing me away. he started to distant himself. i had no choice( btw, from the start he was not into me the way i was into him ) he was taking me for granted.@ yes, i agree thanks @ i did same thing , just remember you was not happy with him when he was in your life. how he treated you, now you are going to have pain for 6month to heal but if you go to him you are going to be in pain for all life. so 6 month pain of breakup is better then all life .@ unfortunately, they dont care for us . i never ever treat someone the way he treated me . i agree with you . he showed his true colors. i was dieing for him he didnt deserve my love .@ we were very different so i dont think he will come back , the pain was he treated me very badly instead of leaving me . finally i left him and he was okay with that . he wanted that but was coward to tell me the true about his feelings.@ we are just making ourselves fool , the way they made us fool.  if they loved us they never left us . i am sorry, i am in same boat@ very true , i thought he was very kind but i was wrong the way he started to treat me ( its painful)@ please dont distant yourself, its like play games and a guy recently did with me . it was really hurting . i asked if he wanted to breakup but he said he dont want . so , please be direct to him. you can block him anytime but its better to talk

      "that isn't always true. i'm 59 and still driven to bigger and better.@ why are people such haters. he earned what he has.@ i cant believe the nerve of them. they are getting money that you should be getting,  not telling you what is going on with your child, and somehow they are ok with it. that would make my want to throttle them. did they take into consideration that he might decide to take off with him. the harm it could potentially. @ that would be enough for me to dump him. why should you have to prove yourself.  there is nothing to prove. what he has can be a long slow end. my father died from it. you will need all the backing you can get. you don't need him doing that to you. good luck, my heart goes out to you.@ my suggestion is put the ball in his court. you can learn a lot about your relationship if you make him do some work for it. you are still very young,  so learn from it.  some things are not worth chasing. even if you catch it, it might not be worth the heart break.@ sounds like you have an amazing personality.@ i understand that feeling. the joy of the chat. the butterflies. cant wait for the next conversation. finding out about each other. but then the bomb drops. she is gone. no goodbyes. then the loneliness comes back with a vengeance. i wonder if you should try again.@ you sound like an interesting person.@ run away as fast as you can. she is a heart break waiting to happen.@ why is there always an age thing. i'm 59 and going strong.@ i could only hope to be lucky enough.@ i've never had that happen. i think you notice it more.@ just ask her \" what would happen if i asked you out to dinner , would that be crossing a line.\"@ i would gladly change or fix what is wrong if i knew. i'm at my wits end an what to do.@ i never thought it was \"all her fault\" . i know i'm not prefect. but it would be nice to talk about it to find out what need to be changed without her getting pissed off@ she says no to counseling. she says no to anything i try. it wold be nice to know why she changed.@ everything there is fine she says.@ when i bring it up she gets mad and storms off.@ i wish it was my fault. but t try to do as much for her is i can.@ trying to \"get frisky\" with her and she shuts me down. romantic dinners, cuddling on the couch, bringing her flowers, telling her she is beautiful. nothing works.\n",
      "who is walking around sees this plant and just goes \"im gonna make this corn hella thicc\"@ when you are arguing with someone and you just hear them inhale like they are about to say something but just hang up instead@ yeah what i meant is if it was at max usage if it would just run better than a cpu that is about to burn because of heat so you can add even more load to it because its cool all the time@ and difference if it was a high or low end cpu?@ yes thats me@ because he doesn't have to watch her through a monitor now which is nice@ me@ i did not have sexual relations with that woman@ we have this in germany too it's called \"brckentag\"@ pineapple pizza isn't even that bad.  now fight@ ouch this hit home@ u are a scam report this guy@ yes daddy@ i would play only the most high end games like minecraft or watch some high quality \"educational\" videos.@ can my motherboard support both?@ if they have enough in stock *looks at 3080*@ the tv im using is  lg49nano867na it's connected with a 4m 2.1 hdmi cable. got both on amazon during prime days@ should i upgrade then?@ it does but i don't want my games to lag@ that's a good point but you have to consider you must also grind for gear and pull weapons before you try to get a new char for your team@ *laughs in 4k and amd freesync*@ \"do you know joe?\" who is joe?@ making plans to game all day but get sleepy the second you start playing@ did he do it on purpose?

 are you actually retarded?@ and thank you for following me just to insult me again totally not weird@ ah yes more insults nice@ so by the downvotes i got in just 10 minutes i assume this will continue  nice@ but you have to understand. what would happen to the vtubers in china if they just shrugged it off? i understand that this was a shit move from them but they were forced to do it@ english is not my first language@ you guys take this way too serious.  there is no way that they will lay off coco or haato that would stupid like really stupid. many dont want to understand that they have livers im china and to protect them they have to punish them you the so called \"fans\" just want to make a bid deal out of it for no real reason other than showing your \"support\" as you call it. you think just because manoe had to go they will fire everybody but you also need to understand that the girl had like 2-3 streams we didn't even know her yet people acted like she was in hololive for many years and was a big part of the community but in reality she was really not. yes it was sad that she had to leave i thought so too that doesn't mean this will happen to every member if they were new members with like a couple a videos i would be scared too but that is not the case so please calm down and think about your actions stop making a big deal out of it this will only hurt the people you watch not the company they work for@ what happened?@ bless you you helped me very much@ thank you i didn't know that@ does that mean my current mainboard could support a 3080? im currently gaming on 1080p but i want to to have more fps and  better resolution@ a 1080p 144hz monitor from lc power@ really? my aim was a high performance cpu for my gpu and that mainboard was recommended on some websites. is it too much can i go for something cheaper?@ it is 3600mhz actually i forgot to write that in my post@ just ok? feel free to criticize me if needed@ what happened in the story?@ my wallet is already hiding behind a corner but thank you for the info@ thank you your reply i thought that my gpu was already outdated but you cleared my misunderstanding@ i did that too@ yes i did extract them into the root folder and tried starting it without mods but that didn't help either@ yes tell me more@ yes i am too@ ah scammers@ and it's not pedophilia no matter how much you think it is 1. there is probably no clear answer for how old she is(like i said the wiki says 16 but a doctor chose her age for her and a second wiki page said her age is unknown / inconclusive) 2. their relationship is realy pure by what i understand (not physical) they could write the story in a way so they get together at a later time 3. i really want to know what the problem is with their relationship you act like rita is about to fuck a teen girl and that is not whats happening@ im pretty sure thats not true and even if does't the story take place in the span of 2 years? that would make her probably 18 atleast@ btw the wiki says her birthdate was chosen for her by a doctor which could mean that she is older than 16@ uninstall the game then you crybaby\n"
